"In the ""important"" category add option ""sort by group and list name"". Do the same for the widget. It is possibol to have important things from different category so categorising it in ""important"" segment make's it cleaner and easyer to track.",2
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,0
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",0
Fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down. super annoying,1
"I am very bad at just starting something and staying with it for a decent amount of time, or at least enough to get it done. This really really helps me in that aspect because I can set reminders, I got the fancy version, that will ping at me whenever I want them to to tell me to work on stuff. Also, every time I look at my little baby tree growing, I kno ""okay I just have this much longer and then I can take a break"" and honestly that is helping me. It is very cute, and user-friendly. 10 / 10",2
"--Update 2--: Okay, I think I have figured it out. The app doesn't sync with the servers on my WiFi, but works fine on my Data connection. Weirdly enough, the web version works on my laptop using the same WiFi. Please fix. --Update 1--: Reinstalled app. Apparently login with Google is completely broken. Not working at all. That's why maybe the data is not syncing? --Original--:No data loads upon startup; just a blank screen with 0 health, 0 xp, and 0 mana.",0
"This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.",2
"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts.",0
"Great and powerful app, except for one thing: location doesn't work when entering addresses. Whenever I type an address with house numbers, the location recommendation list never contains the house number...",1
love it. however when it says homescreen I thought it would show up on the homescreen of my phone... but I order for me to see it I have to open the app. so not as helpful as I thought it would be. is there a way to make it part of my homescreen where is is always present?,2
"I really love this app. With my busy schedule it's so great to have all my day's events plotted out in one great visual. BUT, it drains my battery like crazy! I've lost 10% just typing this out. I have to un-install it. Please. Find a way to fix this so I can re-install!",1
Have difficulty syncing to google calendar,0
still trying,1
very useful and simple. nothing too fancy but still fun no complicated features. i love the multiple lists options and sub category lists. only glitch i find is returning to previous pages after typing...often i have to just hit my home button and navigate all the way back to where i was...but nothing too bad.,1
almost perfect but need time setting for due dates as most students using it will require to have proper time input of their assignments. cheers to the team! did a great job!,2
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran,0
"I love wunderlist, too bad need to transfer to Microsoft to do. UI seems boring, & i tend to forget to use this app. Just make it similar to Wunderlist, the color wallpaper etc. Microsoft UI is too simple, dark is too dark, bright is too boring. Not customizable either. Please improve it",1
"Love the app, but I just purchased the pro version and my Generate Your Personal Flower event gift won't appear in the trees I can use. It says I still need to purchase it, but then I can't purchase it either because the store saya I already have.",1
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",0
"House,üë©üèæ",2
It is an amazingly helpful app I am currently a year 11 student and this has helped tremendously boost my productivity i have seen improvements not only in my results but also me as a person as I lost lots of my bad habits and gained good ones. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES (non--academic/academic),2
Good but doesnt make me go do habits bcz no pressure just notif.,1
"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",2
"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.",2
Good UI and helpful options. Have recently purchased the pro version for extra functionality,2
Used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until I found out that none of my trees die when I switch apps. Tried all the instructions in the FAQs section of their website but nothing worked. Great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone.,0
"It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.",2
"This was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight. I cannot recommend this app. I would try something similar maybe open sources, or with dev support",0
This was OK for a few days but now  when I open it it is just a blank screen and I have lost all my  tasks. Very annoying as these were important reminders !,0
"It's good overall. It has a variety of cute options for trees. I had some issues with an alarm I'd forgotten about going off from another app & causing a tree to die unless I watched an ad. It takes a long time to get enough coins to buy other trees. There isn't a formula available to estimate how long it would take. Discouraging. I liked the idea that was posted about having animals get drawn to healthy forests over time. I wanted pro several times, but don't trust myself with whitelist.",2
Everything I wanted it for I had to do the pro mode,0
I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed,0
C'mon. To have more than 10 lists I've to pay!? Nope... That's not gonna happen,0
This app is super best,0
"It's a good app. It fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores, which is pretty hard to pull off. I'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires.",2
"Could be as good as Wunderlist was, but please change the new tasks to appear at the top of the lists!",0
Your app was gud but when i did reset my phone and install this again app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want it doesn't protect me to other apps... If i use other apps while tree is growing they don't die... Your app is really useless,0
"This is a very cool app, and thus have the ratings. How ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users. This will make it the all in one Project/Task manager. Review Update : Previously, I was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event, but now I can't and I have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time I want to create a new event. This is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time. Please fix this",1
I didn't like the way the lists would set up...,1
"You can't choose week starts day. Calendar is a basis. Additional customization looks reasonable. Moreover, MS support marked this request as ""in progress"" . But 2!!! years ago. Is it a joke?",0
"This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.",2
The tree store does not work.... Please fix Other than that great app does what it intends to do.,0
Best app!!,2
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",0
"I could not figure out how to set reminders. And I did NOT want to ""register""",0
"For $4.99 to $9.99, I'd like more widgets and customization. As it stands, the main widget, ""List"", is block white.",1
this app helps me stay organized with my online work during quarantine. it reminds of assignments that are overdue and lets me set priorities for each assignments. really helpful app if you're a procrastinator like i am.,2
"No reply to my TickTick Premium cancellation mail, since 2 days. --------------- New update, another day has passed and no reply to mail has been received yet.",0
Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,2
Unable to give color to events. Only blue color is coming,1
Who wants to pay $3 a month? The free version just tries to upsell you the premium version while you're trying to use it.,0
gr8 app.... keep up the good work,2
"The app is real comfortable for use, the only thing I can't understand is how to view the events you create from the calendar icon top left?",2
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive,0
since the May 1st update it made me create my character 15+ times before I uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones. Terrible. I love the app otherwise. Update: since the new update it is fixed.,2
Felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done.,1
The app does not work after last nights update,0
Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.,2
Not for me,1
No matter what settings I choose I get no sound when timer is up. App would be great if I could hear when timer is up. It makes sound when going through menu. Sent an email over a week ago. All these months later and still same issues.,0
Love this app! The only thing that is missing for me is the ability to long click on a day in any view and be able to give it a bespoke colour so I know that there is something important I need to be aware of on that date. If that was there it would be 5 stars,2
"The idea is great, and I would have loved this. However I WILL NOT pay to be able to use different routines for different days. This app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment. Don't bother with this one.",0
"No bad habits to simply punish me, just could make good habits?",2
"There's nothing wrong with this app, although it could be slightly better, but.... It's just like Google Calendar. In fact, it's integrated with Google Calendar, and all your events show up in GC. Even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same. If you're an android user, go ahead and just use the built in Google calendar, if not your Samsung/HTC/whatever one. I have near stock android, so I get Google.  Same difference, really.",1
Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..,2
The new update causes forest to freeze leaving no choice but to exit the app. But doing so erases the exited session. Please fix this asap.,1
"This app has been great for me, especially to track daily goals I set for myself. it shows me the days I have succeeded, and the days Ive fallen short. I can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure I don't miss a daily goal. I've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with!",2
Fantastic,2
Nested can be improved,0
"i dont like the new update. tapping the circle to finsish taps is not nearly as satisfactory as the swipe from before. more importantly however, this means i very easily mark tasks as done from the widget by accident as it only requires one tap now. (before the widget required 2 taps to mark a task done which is how wdgets should be).",1
demo demo ..not compatible with outlook..,0
"Having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying, it's really boring otherwise. Reminders don't work properly - I set a bunch for last night that never happened, and a bunch this morning that never happened. It's not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so... It's not really useful for me.",1
"it technically does most of things you would want a list app "" to do "", but it seems to make them a bit tougher than other apps, or charges",1
"Useless. Have to pay a subscription to be reminded? No thank you. Honestly a once off fee is fair, but a continued yearly fee. I can see why these guys partnered with Facebook and mark Suckerberg . To suck your wallet. I gave it 3 stars because it is a well made app.",1
i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have,0
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...,0
"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG. Also, if there was a quicker way to edit like in Life RPG that would be great. I would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys, but right now LifeRPG is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up. Love the decreasing skills btw :)",1
"The new version is too complicated to use and I could not find any directions. However, a application with a easier use will be my preference.",0
Crashing a lot after update,1
Great,2
"Idea is cool (not for everyone); I'm removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves; and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen - I'd edit some task from Dailies and after it's saved, I'm placed back to Habits, for example.",1
great app. love it,2
There are much more eady to do list apps. This one is not intuitive and no time to waste searching. Maybe could be interesting after getting used to it.,1
"Somehow, reminder function has never work. No notification or anything. Which make this app kinda useless.",0
I downloaded a bunch of habit-tracking apps to test them out before New Year's. Habitbull seemed the most intuitive and straightforward. I really like the design (shows the streak on the calendar) and the fact that it nudges you if you don't check in during the day. There's even a community function where you can share the struggle with others doing the same thing. Great app.,2
"Just started hence neutral stars. I was going to write to the devs but I see you reply here. Open is good. I don't know what a filtered list is. That is my only confusion so far. I was interested in premium but put off by the monthly fee rather than a single license. Meanwhile I was playing with the idea of selling each premium feature separately. That would give you information about what your users want - especially after you add computer support. Feed the wolf you want, Linux 1st.",1
UI Needs to be improved,1
"I like: * the way it separates lists (""sub lists"") horizontally, and I can switch between them conveniently with swipes, though I tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists * I value the convenience of swipe to delete the most * being able to quick add tasks from the main screen, removes one extra tap step * being able to highlight important tasks, but wish it would automatically pin them to the top. Feature I wish most for: Image attachments. Idea: Location-based reminders?",2
"Good, could be much better. Missing the critical feature to sort first alphabetically and then display all incomplete tasks before all complete tasks. ALSO, should have an option for the ""tasks"" in the To Do lists to NOT appear as Tasks in Outlook/Exchange!",1
Extremely easy user interface. Helpsnin using the app more and note the goals.,2
"WOW I REALLY LOVE THIS APP!!! Such a great idea. I first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility & organization, we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress. I generally enjoy this game, it is the only one have on my phone.",2
What I love is that I can make multiple calendars with the same account. What are some Major problems? 1. My events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who I include in the event. Sending a text message link doesn't work either. 2. I have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation. Never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a Very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to... This is detrimental. P.S. I paid for premium,0
I love this app however I sent the link to several friends and they got the app and I received no premium time whatsoever . Don't be dishonest with your apps . That's lame .,1
Great app. I suggest having more reminder options,2
"Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.",0
"I like this app, but in the world of Time/Schedule Management you have to be multi-platform. I would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a PC or laptop.",1
"I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.",0
"Simple and intuitive. I don't even know for sure how long I've been using TickTick, but at the time I tried multiple free to-do list apps, and this one was by far my favorite. It allows my tasks to auto reset on a schedule of my choice. I get reminders for the day, but can also set reminders ahead of time (down to a specific time of day if preferred).",2
Sound is not coming while the task is reminding.. How to get sound? without sound while reminding is not useful..please tell how to enable sound,1
"I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.",0
great app reasanable pro features please add multibe avatars(for the kids),2
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise",1
can not invite my friend who's using Êª¥Á≠îÊ∏ÖÂçï to join my list. and IDK how to give feedback in the app.,1
"Best and most effective habit app I've tried. However, adding new tasks is 
very frustrating, because the sorting feature is buggy. Sometimes the item 
you're moving disappears for a time, sometimes the item jumps out of place. 
This might sound trivial, but I have a lot of tasks, and being able to sort 
them is an essential feature for me. I'm on Android 6.0 (LG G4).",1
"I tried 3 or 4 times to download this app, import my Wunderlist data, and share lists with my husband. Each time it failed miserably. Not trying again - finding a better app.",0
Nice but cost too much yearly to buy.,2
Useful easy to use and fulfil my needs But i still didn't experience it's use in sharing or groups,1
"Won't sync with my Calendar, Sam-Note 10",0
Great app. I wish I had more chance to add reminders without buying premium.,1
very bad experience,0
Not remind me,0
Wunderlist was better!! Please change the UI back to Wlist style which makes it easier to read. For example don't have completed and non completed tasks right next to each other in a list. Also comments needs to be separated automatically with a date specified that states which date that comment was added and by who,0
"Love hate relationship. The app is great.. It nags and nags and @*! @@! nags per your settings until you want to kill it.. Dead!! And then again! But it does its job. The reminders are rude, intrusive, nagging, annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list. I HATE it.. But it's supreme for procrastinators, busy people, air heads, and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target. Phone/setting dependent",2
good,1
Very nice App,2
Its good but can work on notifocation panel,2
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?",1
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.,0
So far so good,2
"For someone who does this on the side, the developer is the most responsive I've ever seen! I've tried at least 6 other popular list apps, and this one is my favorite. It does the best job of laying out lists and sublists that I could find.",2
Works great. Looks great. Excellent features. Everything I need in a calendar widget. I don't actually use the app,2
Excellent super app. Gift my god. Thankyou,2
helpful but not too much,1
"I used to really love this app and I still do for its flexibility and functionality. I was considering getting the pro version but because I am a small business owner, it was not yet necessary. Since the recent change to the new add format, I am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish (oftentimes no skip option). The adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared I tought I was hacked. It's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version..",1
I have gone between this and the google calendar app. I like this because it expands the features that are missing in google calendar,2
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,0
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive",1
"Just migrated to Tick Tick - it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in Todoist. Sorry guys, it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive.",1
Just started using it....the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what I do.,2
good not bad,0
"Excellent app, continuous improvements make app be in the top 1% of Productivity category",2
Why take down show more or less function on Note after latest update version (Dec. 17 2019)? It's really useful.,2
waste of time,0
nice!,1
It's almost perfect. The widgets on homescreen need more options. A list of events for the day instead of only the monthly view is a necessity. Add it and I'm sold!,1
i like the design,2
not enough customatization,1
"Nice widget, and I don't mind a few ads, but persistent ads are annoying. When I get annoyed, I tend to rather go somewhere else, than becoming a paying customer.",0
"absolutely amazing app, the best for to do lists.",2
"The app didn't work for me at first, but after uninstalling a few times it eventually worked, and I love it! This is great for me as a college student because it makes keeping up with homework and assignments easier by adding an element of fun!",2
"Great app! The app offers very interesting and unique features as well . But there is only one problem for people like myself. I spend most of my time doing some work on my laptop, and I try as much as I can to ignore my cellphone whilst working. If only I could manipulate and change my schedule in TimeTune accordingly on my laptop or pc it would be perfect.",2
Just downloaded the app better review later on,1
soo bugy,1
"Won't sync with my Calendar, Sam-Note 10",0
i hate itüò†,0
Well it's broken now. I haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm. It just vibrates. I checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder. Why do these reminder apps always break?,0
The app was awesome but it stopped working in a week. I'm not able to add any routine now.,1
"This is by far my favorite habit tracking app (and I've tried many). I like the weekly view. (I have an unusual use for this app.....I use it to track my kids' school work and I like the weekly view so I can see what they have completed during the week). However, I'm not sure if this app is still being supported? The last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries. But the app does still work well.",2
"Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year.",1
"The team fixed importing bookmarked tasks from Wunderlist, since about a year ago. After using ToDo for couple days, I can say it's *almost* on par with Wunderlist. But, given that it's advertised as a replacement, developed by the same team, it's frustrating that not all behavior was backported. No quickly prioritizing tasks by toggling bookmark state, no list selection and delete. Hard to deal with duplicate lists after importing. Custom sorting, so you add a task via widget, but cannot see it",0
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.,0
"I love this app, but recently the app keeps crashing everytime I enter. Plus the calendar is completely wrong. üòï",0
Want upgraded version even to set the duration . Pathetic app.,0
Really frustating configuration...,0
"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired.",1
Great app. Would love a desktop version that syncs.,2

Unable to download,1
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful...",1
Give more features on par with Google Keep. Dark mode too is an essential tool that's sorely missing.,2
"Each of the features acts like it should. Only two things kept this from five stars: 1 - the reminder is set by default to 15 min and there is no easy way to turn that off or set it to another time. 2 - the events are colorless, making them less at-a-glance for looking up your plans for the day. Other than those two things, I've got no complaints.",2
It doesn't work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks.  I have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly.,1
I want to start my week with Saturday and it is not available! only can change between Sunday & Monday !,0
no use,0
It does not ync eith al the calendars,0
Kind of boring,0
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.,0
MKBHD suggested this app. The free version is very good. Gets my work done.,2
"Had to create Microsoft account to use which annoyed me, however, can use Gmail account and can import from Wunderlist which is a plus. Also signed in on a different device that I have office suite on. Next time I signed into Outlook with work credentials, To Do signed me out. Now can't sign into app on my phone, so weird!",1

"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)",2
"This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",0
"I love this format, only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element, build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing",2
Loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events,1
Another update but the stats section is still totally useless and buggy. Week starts with Sunday even i changed to monday. On a sunday the stats resets and stays empty for the whole day. To update the progress % i have to exit and enter the app several times.,0
Reall well,2
Cool,2
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.,2
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,2
"I have suceeded 100% and indicates so in the tracker but only says 87% on the app. one of my goals was yoga on Mondays, not sure if it is penalizing me for the other days.",1
"Took more than 3 years, but they've finally managed to get BC2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original. 3/10/2019.. update. Unfortunately, usability is severely compromised. Busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view. Tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots (10:05 or 14:40). Clock to set times is backward step from BC1 which is BY FAR the best way to set times on a calendar. I like the auto link to contacts in bc2. 2 line favorites bar pls.",1
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoy√© a l autre...,0
Bad experience. The support is the worst ever. And no thought has been put except for the visual ui. The ux is bad.,0
It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,2
"Trying to sync my calendar with both my phone and tablet, and any notes and/or tasks are not syncing between my devices.  Having to duplicate these items is very frustrating.",1
Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.,0
"very nice app but the simple features that many other apps has for free, cost money on this app so why would a pay for somethings that it should be free!",1
Please add two options : 1- tag or label in task and list 2- password to enter application Thanks for free,2
"When I'm entering birthdays, I have to enter on the day after, or it shows up the day before!! I have one birthday permanently hooked to a holiday, and I can't edit it. Fix this, PLEASE.",1
As I am a regular user of this app...This app needs some update like the calendar based listing method. People will go to date and list the task...Another problem is so many color for list. It's annoying... Who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list... That is all...üôÇüôÇüôÇ,1
"I came from Wunderlist as I got an email said it was shutting down on March 6th. I was expecting a sub par experience, having to re-enter all of my tasks and data. I was very surprised as it was a great switch over experience with very little input from me! It also has a very similar widget which im very happy with! Thank you for considering Wunderlist users!",2
easy to use.,2
Good app,2
It's been good using this app to track habit formation,2
Very useful! Syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks,2
"I like this app, It is an amazing tool, however I couldn't find calendar and where I can track what I have done. Could you help me find it?",2
"Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.",0
Pretty good a little buggy with data for example i have more then 0 postive adds to eating 1 fuit and vegi also there should be a cap to tapping like a cap people can set or an option so that acidental tapping dossent happen other then this its a great app,2
"Could be a lot better. I wish we were able to check off items in our 
routine as we finish them so we can move on to the next task. I would also 
like to see a timer associated with the routines so we can see if we are 
falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted. I have my morning 
routine, but it has multiple tasks within it. If we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine, it would make things look more organized. All in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized, but I don't think I 
wouldn't use this app until the mentioned points are added. If these all 
exist already, please let me know- because I couldn't figure out how to get 
to them",1
Love the calendar.,2
"Works great, but when I start creating events and switch to a different app and go back to Business Calendar, they disappear. Also, very limited, unsearchable collection of emojis. No statistics on events, too. Would also love to see goal tracking. Needs prioritizements of tasks. Also, no option to find a time for an event.",1
"I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.",2
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone...",0
"Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment.",0
Great app but as someone else mentioned there's no calendar view which for me makes it pointless. Real Shame. The search goes on...,1
"This application which I used thoroughly, and this application seriously deserves 5 stars ‚ú®. I have given 4 stars because it don't have multiple user merged account in it. Which helps our 4 members of family to write their to-do in a single place.",2
"""Sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks. Upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task"". Are you serious guys? Pro version for more subtasks? Why 199, why not unlimited?",0
"Great app, a section to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, addresses.would be a great addition",2
This app is not worth the $6 a year. Poorly developed with several glitches.,0
"The aap good but not some updates are required, such as - In notes section add photo upload option, Add Journal Option,",1
"Real hassle to set up with synchronization with others. I cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it, with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared. I much preferred wunderlist which worked fine. Why won't Microsoft leave well alone? I do not need this app to run my life, just keep lists which can be mine or shared.",0
"It would help me to better schedule my tasks if the feature to repeat a task could be made to be more fluid, i.e. instead of only allowing users to key in ""every week"", ""every day"" etc., it would be better if it allows ""Aug 28, Oct 5, Nov 11"" .",1
"A negative experience.  I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing.  I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems  you can't cancel the app except through the app.  This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it.  Other apps on my phone with subscriptions I can cancel through Google Play.  Apparently not this one.",0
"Pro Version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly. Please fix it, I've restarted my phone several times and still nothing.",1
Like another commenter said. Just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesn't give my my paid for premium. Previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago.,0
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.,0
Works great!,2
"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks",1
"Every tiny feature of this app requires an 'upgrade'. If you're planning to use a free version of this app, don't bother. The developers are hands down, the most money-hungry developers I've ever seen.",0
Good,2
Please fix dark mode!,0
Useful.,0
"Despite logging out of all my google accounts and restaring my phone, I still can't restore my premium account.",0
A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.,1
Widget sering ngadat dan ndak update dengan hari dan jamnya. Butuhnya pasang widget agar terupdate tapi seringnya malah gak cocok dengan waktunya. Notifikasinya pun sering g muncul.,1
"Great pomodorro -like method for staying on task with a built in reward. Whitelisting was free at first, they should've kept it free and added* other desireable features they could've offered at a price.",1
The app is good but it is crashing a lot. It is instructing to upgrade but i did not find any option for upgrade. I am also a pro version user. I have to uninstall the app and later re-install it again to make it work for only 120mins.,0
"I like what its trying to do and want to use it, but it's missing a few things. To-Do doesn't support formatting AT ALL (mobile or PC), and any formatting you do in Outlook is erased and spacing is messed up. To-Do has the ability to create subtasks but doesn't translate over to Outlook. The To-Do app on PC doesn't allow you to enlarge the task/note window so your forced to type in this little box on the side of the window. PLEASE FIX THESE!!",0
I had given 5 stars in Jun 2017. I'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed. I'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable. I'll just switch to Google calendar which syncs better anyway. Thanks for the few years of a great app.,0
"Good, bt nt what I was looking for.",0
I started playing with it and it freezes often and I don't like how my notes have to be on that day and not just by themselves.,1
"Hi, I love this app and have been using it for a while now (it is the only 
one that have calendar and to-do fit togheter), the only thing that I would 
add for my needs is the possibility to share with others our activities. 
Even in the paid version seems to not have this feature. Are you guys 
planning to add it on?",2
Microsoft is like Wanderlist. Originally had issues sharing and syncing this To Do List app. Appears to be settling down. We like to it now.,2
"Pretty decent to-do app, with probably the least annoyances of the very many I've tried over the years. I'm yet to find my perfect match though. The app sometimes require unnecessarily many taps to get something done. It's easy enough to understand, it's just not the smoothest user experience.",1
Great app only problem is that whenever I set reminders for the task I set I don't really receive them would definitely rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed,1
Please extend the beta program with more seats üòä,2
Needs to have feature where you add the next item to the top of the list not the bottom - Widget version,1
"Needs a widget! Once it has multiple different widgets, calendar, to do list, grocery list...etc I might revisit it.",1
"It used to be a great app, but since you took away ability to change/delete a single event in a series of the recurring events - it's not good for me any more üòû",0
"So far, the best habit tracking app I've tried, the only one I was able to actually stick to using. If only full version would be more avaliable..",2
"Functional, not beautiful. Nothing particularly advantageous compared to other calendar apps.",1
"This app is great as far as the calendar and task functions. However, it is nearly unbearable to use since it doesn't respect the phone setting to not notify during a call. When it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app (not Skype, Hangouts or other app), it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive. I sent in a support request 3.5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to ""look into it."" But they haven't fixed it in any updates and it's been the same on all of the different phones I've had since then, not just an isolated issue on one phone.",1
"I don't know why everyone's complaining that you can't re-order tasks and lists. Drag-and-drop with a long press works just fine for me. At first glance, I seem to have FINALLY found a suitable replacement for GTasks.",2
Wish they add : copy paste function Remind specified time before due date options,1
Good,2
LOVE this calendar!! I don't know how I remembered anything I had to do before!! The notifications are SO helpful as you can dismiss or snooze for 5 minutes to days! Highly recommend!!,2
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed,0
"OK, I've finally found something to replace my beloved CloudCal and CloudTasks, which seem to have been abandoned, as the dev is communicating NOTHING to customers. TickTick, has a similar not that steep learning curve, but, once you catch on, it is fast, flexible, efficient, and gorgeous (I run the Dark mode.), which is actively updated. My new ""go to"" task manager and calendar. Great job, devs!",2
"Wunderlist has a date time stamp on comments. When the list was imported, the date time stamp is no longer available.",0
5stars,2
"This is a good app, however it has a few bugs that need attention that could easily make the app 5 stars.",1
"was working fine for couple years. Now... 1. it creates duplicates of repeating events 2. while trying to change notification sounds, it switched to silent with no way to restore 3. FAQ to allow single repeated event deletion says to sync to get 'only this event'; but 'sync now' closes menu w/o synching",1
"Syncing doesn't work, still no reply from support",1
"I love using forest as a timer when I study, however there is the ethical issue that you can't plant real trees unless you have premium. This really frustrates me because they took an opportunity to help the environment and turned it into an opportunity to make money. I understand that they need the money from buying premium to plant the trees, but it feels like they are making people feel guilty in order to sell premium to them. Thank you for the response, I appreciate you taking the time.",1
You can't even try it out. They are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything.,0
This is terrible compared to wunderlist. I use wunderlist to sync my family's repeating chores. I was used to clicking 'today' and having everything there and in folders that needed to be done past and present. Now i have to choose what i do everyday! Also if i skip a task and want to reset it to today so it can repeat in 2 weeks it retains the day so repeats in less than two weeks. And the folders? What's the point in having folders if you can't sort by them in any list?Is there an alternative?,0
"seems to be usable, i am too accustomed to wunderlist, i wish i could star items to be put on a starred list",2
"Please, make the widget minimalistic/customizable/half-transoerent like in com.stuff.todo. What you have now it too cluncky, all-branded and in most cases doesn't fit homescreen aesthetically. Also make it possible to use different colors for sub and subsub tasks (for example, white, grayer, gray). Shifting from the left is not enough.",1
Not as good as Wunderlist. Going to need to find a new app ‚òπÔ∏è,0
This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,1
THE BEST TO DO APP EVER! Now I don't forget any important things on my mind. I can write or record at anytime or anywhere. Thanks MS,2
I love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so... üü¢I don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into. üü¢I don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time. Lol üòú üü¢AND I dont have to check things off!!!! The app just checks it off for me with a single tap.,2
Would gladly pay for this if it was Outlook compatible.,1
Useless. No nesting,0
"Love it especially the natural language e.g write every tuesday, friday do ... Then it will automatically repeat ... Every tuesday, friday.",2
A great tool to see what's going on in your day. I linked work and personal calendars into one. The customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to.,2
"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",2
nice,1
üò∂üò∂üò∂üò∂,0
This game/app is so easy to use and so much fun. Thank u so much for making habitica!,2
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better.",1
This is one cool app. Not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint.,2
I dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference.,1
Wunderlist is far better. This is no way close,0
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.",0
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,0
Why so many tracking scripts? One or two should be enough. No I'm not a free user. Dark themes are underwhelming. Contrast not good enough in them.,1
Not bad,1
Very Helpful! I can see what I have accomplished and organize my week with what I want to do.,2
"When I first downloaded the app it worked seamlessly, but once I upgraded to the Pro version it began to lag and slow down. I can't access my timeline, store or achievements anymore and it's slow run time is making the app so tedious to use. It's becoming an awful app for me",0
I have a moto e 1st gen and I updated forest app using Google play. Result. Forest app gets a crash everytime i try to use it. Fix the bug. It runs Android kitkat.,1
"Love this app, would love to have the ability to have a desktop version that sync'd with my phone. Maybe add this ability to permium users? Overall very pleased with this app. keeps a busy schduled organized, especially where multiple calendars are involved.",2
"Good at keeping me focused,",2
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer,0
"I have a problem. The ""I want to..."" bar at the bottom is covering up the ""someday"" subsection of tasks. Please fix this.",1
It's a good tool.,2
I love this app.... It helped me improve my lifestyle.... Nd made me a better more mature version of myself... The only gripe is that plz allow us to whitelist some apps.... Like I know it's there in the premium version but at least allow like two three apps to be whitelisted.... That would help us so much,2
"This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.",0
"Waste , there was not an option to set an alarm to remind . I can write a note anywhere , I need the note to remind me which this app said it would . Too busy trying to get me to but it . I will just but an alarm clock",1
"BEWARE the trial period is a scam I've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad. After 5 days I realized it didn't quite organize my information how I best work so I wrote to cancel. They informed me that I must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict Terms cannot refund me. So I wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the Ad, but they said it's not possible. Really?",0
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.,0
Nice App... Will suggest some changes after some time,1
"technically a paid app(pay for reminders), UI not as attractive as related apps.",0
"Great concept, but can they hire an artist, this artwork is outdated!! otherwise I would use this",0
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .",0
"Awesome app! It helps me a lot to organize my life, work and other stuffs. The features are really amazing! Would recommend this to my friends and colleagues.",2
Can you add time in notes also like events,2
"Thus far, I'm enjoying this app. I feel absolutely motivated in completing a task; and, staying on track. Even, when I feel like getting off track, I'm reminded of the growth that's manifesting between my tree and myself. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the best app ever. Looking forward to additional features!",2
Solid. Perhaps overpriced.,2
Very useful,2
"Very cool app. Using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun. Could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface, but it's still close to perfect and runs great.",2
Brilliant app,2
"It's really a great app and good concept to cure phone addiction. But I've some ideas for making it more interesting. Introduce forest customization options- like a real forest. Add animals, Cascades etc. Anyway great work guys!",1
"I use the app daily for routine planning and habit tracking. Multi-device app with constant improvements by the developer, the app keeps on getting better",2
"Smooth and simple UI. Devs could make setting an alarm for tasks even simpler with less taps, since I use reminders at specific times for each task.",2
"The new notifications are atrocious. The don't follow light or dark theme in Android 10, they don't work well with Wear OS, and they turn on my screen when I don't want them to. I'm now getting reminder pop-ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone. 10/24/2019 - I downgraded to v5.2.3 and got the Reminder Pop-ups option in Settings > Notifications back. When I update to 5.3.0 the Reminder Pop-ups option is replaced with Notifications and Notification Font options.",0
"Do not buy premium! Devs are not responsive and there is no way to reach them should you have any issues. Contacted them several times to transfer purchase to new phone, nobody responded.10$ wasted.",0
i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated ...,0
"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect.",1
"Uhmm I love the idea of this and enjoy using it at the same time. It will 
be amazing if the app could offer to change the date format, for ex 
actually it is month/day/year for me it's too weird, I'll prefer something 
like year/month/day or day/month/year",1
"1 star bc I was forced to change apps yet there are no meaningful improvements from Wunderlist but boy are there downgrades! Harder to share lists with my husband, syncing is spotty, didn't improve the calendar view to let you see your schedule, the My Day only allows you to manually add one task at a time by opening each task and moving it. I have to manually add it if it's due ""today""?! This is a HUGE flop! Killed Wunderlist and now I have to pay for a different app that actually works",0
"Fantastic absolutely best of it's kind. No ads, great system of to dos dailies and habits (that you want to have and break) plus the tavern/guild/challenge/quest/party system really keeps you motivated, as does the in art or out of world reward system. Absolutely fantastic.",2
"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.",0
"It doesn't ring the alarm at the right time. only when I open my phone, it starts ringing. useless for me because I want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone. Highly disappointed! :(",0
"I absolutely adore this app. It keeps me from getting overwhelmed, but also keeps my house clean because I only take care of what's on my Tasks that day.",2
Waste of time failed to pair with mu gmail account...gave up after 5 attempts,0
Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.,2
You have to upgrade to get notifications...,0
"It's not working properly, always fails to Remind, no more reminder notification, this feature suppose to work for free version, if the promise features in free version doesn't work how can I get confident to buy paid version , request team to fix this issue",0
"Good but very confusing It was good if I knew how to use it. The whole set up was very confusing and hard to understand, I really hope in the future it becomes simpler",1
It's pretty good. I wish you could change the type of selector though (yes/no vs x times a day) after habit creation. It seems there is no way to do this yet.,2
"First, thanks to the forestapp team for making this brilliant app. Second, in Iran we cannot pay for the Pro version. Please find a solution to this problem. :(",0
Felt very complicated when i am flying high.,1
would give 5 stars but locking the aync function through a subscription sucks,1
notification does not sound. pls develop......... Why can not be set for 6 days in a routine week ...? Please like this,1
It worked for the first week. Now I can't add a task without it crashing.,0
Good one,2
It does not play ring tone on my mobile.,1
"It's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex:C1 A4 B2 etc; we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those .Thanks.",1
"As much as I love the concept and I really do want to use it, the app doesn't log my times. I'll plant, and study, then when I come back (and my tree is supposed to be done growing) it'll just start up like nothing happened. I've had an empty forest for two days now.",0
Great task and project management app. User friendly and versatile. Lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements. Would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements... 1) there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline/due date. 2) would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects.,2
Awesome to use,2
It was great for 1 day! I cant open it! A waste of time! I need to uninstall and download it again for it to work for just 1 freaking day! Dont download!,1
Best productivity app. Very intuitive to use and a must have for power users,2
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up.",0
That's right. Nice addon but haven't really seen its power yet as I still don't have those colorful sectors show on the app,1
"couldn't create my avatar at first, but after that it worked fine.",2
"It's amazing and it helps me so much when writing, but these days it keeps crashing all the time :(",1
Downloaded the app...uninstalled within the 5 days they offer you for free. Now I noticed they charged me a full year subscription of 900+ INR. What a sneaky way to generate revenue....,0
"I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...",0
Really amazing and helped me sooo much just i hope that it can be sharable by more than one person for group planning one line and it will be world organizer or making groups ... thanx for developers,2
"Its seem complex in the first time.  Anyway,  can see all activity in the big picture",1
"very good. it is a bit complicated to use. It should probably have a tutorial or an expailnation about the different functions, as some of them just seem to be the same thing with just a differeent look. (i could just be stupid, which is a possibility).",2
Nice,2
"Use this app every day and used to totally love it. But in the last month or so they have allowed full-page video ads to take over the screen. The only way to get rid of them is to force close the app, which I now do repeatedly. Can't continue like this! Totally unacceptable. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking. Downright stupid business decision. Looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as I can. It was nice while it lasted.",0
"Didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar, started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender. I'm screwed on those, was planning on using this for personal use only.",1
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,0
The dailies and habits should reset everyday.please let them reset,0
"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. I used to love it, but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable. I am switching to google calendar and never looking back",0
App not work after purchase...plz dont buy. User Interface not good. Beacuase eralier version is good..,0
It's such a spectacular idea but I had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day-to-day basis.,1
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you",2
"After purchasing the Pro Version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now, I have grown to truly love it. It mimicks as close to the Franklin Covey Planner's to any app out there I have found and this is what has drawn me to it. I am increasing my rating to 4 stars, because I have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and I love that it will sink with my Google calendar and other calendars. I love this app, I only wish it could print.",2
Won't show events I add to it. Makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason. Really annoying.,0
"The single FranklinCovey planner feature available is the Task ABC123 priorities system, but oddly the Task status system is missing. No more FC system functionality. As of the rest it's a very conventional PIM suite with a little of CRM salt & pepper.",0
This app is awesome though it hangs most of tge time after I finish growing a tree. But in overall I love it. And I hope this app will have more features in the future,2
"Sound now works but when I have the phone's Do Not Disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound. I have it set to ignore Do Not Disturb and have it set to alarm. My other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as Task, so it's not my phone causing no sound issue, what else could it be Stephen? You get it working and you get 4 stars, restore still does not work, gave up on that.",1
"the app work just fine, it was my commitment that had problem üòÇüòÇüòÇ",1
"If you're a procrastinator this app will change your life! I have a tendency to avoid the things I need to do by snacking or playing video games so this app has been perfect for me. I'm great at making to-do lists but suck at execution. This app has helped me with so many areas of my life, chores around the house, my quality of work at my job, I've even been using it to develop safer driving habits. The community is also very supportive, it's really fun to play with a friend and party up.",2
"I really love this. But when I want to use it for second time, this apps crashed. I've uninstalled for many times but it still the same. Please do something",0
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating.",0
I really like so far. I makes my daily routine a bit fun and make it meant something in a way.,2
bit complicated in adding routines.. I didn't understood,1
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",2
I love this app. It's easy to customise. Can you add a feature for a timer? That way people can measure how long they did a certain task for.,2
"Such a useful app. Never again will I miss reminders, or find it too much hassle to add a task. Would like to be able to change the default reminder time without having to amend every one, and would like to see support for tasks from non exchange accounts (e.g hotmail etc.) but even with these unavailable to me the app is still amazing. I thoroughly recommend this.",2
I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.,2
"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.",0
Microsoft To Do does almost all of this for free. It is pointless to pay such a hefty sum of money for these so-called premium features!!!,0
"Pretty good app, lets you organize tasks by categories, prioritize based on due dates and set reminders for each specific task. However, sometimes, reminders fail to notify you in the specified time and come rather delayed.",2
"I love this app! It helps me to stay focused on my work or whatever other tasks I've set for myself, and helps me track time on those tasks. I like the whitelist feature so that I can use apps on my phone that are necessary for work while growing a tree. And I love plants! So keeping them alive is a real incentive. Thank you for creating it!",2
"While it's actually increased my productivity, it would sometimes just crash for no reason, killing the tree. This is honestly pretty annoying. My device is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4.",1
Easy to use and customize,2
"Events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them, other times a certain day will not be selectable. choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work.",2
A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,0
"I can say this is a nice app! I often see this app on so many study videos. But i just start to use this app now and when i plant the tree, i can still open other apps and the tree didn't die...please help",1
Awesome. Simple and easy to use.,2
I cannot even create an account I fill in what's needed and I'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help.,0
"Great to do app, seemless integration with Windows. Would love to see the option to open the mobile app with the My Day tab already open.",2
Exactly what I have been looking for. Love it,2
Been very happy with this app. I love the widget and calendar view that show the names of the events in calendar view. Very helpful!,2
Your app was gud but when i did reset my phone and install this again app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want it doesn't protect me to other apps... If i use other apps while tree is growing they don't die... Your app is really useless,0
Great! intuitive and easy to use.,2
"It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!",2
"Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.",0
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!,0
Looks good. But doesn't have web version. Would be 5 stars if I was rating author's dedication. Functionality wise can't give more than 3. The app is inferior to Any.do or microsofts todo,1
For god sake change the default color this red is burning my eyes,2
It is great! Simple as that.,2
"I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working",0
Hi. Thanks for responding and I'll be more specific: Please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines. The current color is too pale.,1
It's an amazing app. Does what it promises. Easy to use and a cool feature is it pushes due tasks to the next day which helps a lot.,2
ÈùûÂ∏∏Ê£í Êï¥‰Ωì‰πüÂæàÁÆÄÊ¥ÅÊòé‰∫Ü ÈùûÂ∏∏ÂñúÊ¨¢‚ù§Ô∏è,2
It's okay.. Why not a simple yes/no box instead or colored circles? It's really confusing. Also not a fan of the general navigation.,1
"OK, it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday!",1
"BE AWARE OF IRRECOVERABLE DELETIONS! Worked fine until I accidentally erased some IMPORTANT DATA I had been gathering for a few years. Guess what, there is no UNDO!!! No way to recover anything. Had I known that, I'd NEVER use this POS. TickTick, if you want to have cool and modern features like Google, AUTO SAVE in particular, you MUST back it up with a fricken VERSION CONTROL feature! Otherwise just go back 100 years to ""Are you sure you want to save/delete?"" confirmation dialogues.",0
"This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.",0
Bekar,0
"I'm a pro user, worked great initially but it is not opening and continuously stopping. Please fix this asap.",0
"It's a great app. You can search for words in tasks. The reminders show up on my new Samsung S10, which is why I had to ditch Keep. To get five stars, I would like to see an easy way to access the app on my desktop. It would be great if it would work with Google calendar.",2
"I like this app and use it on my Android phone and iOS iPad. It's easy to use, don't need to buy anything, and is clear. I don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how I expected, but it's a good app.",2
"Still using the app, still happy with it.",2
"From an old Wunderkist fan: Design and migration is nice thank you. Please bring back weekly to do widget or at least make possible to select only ""earlier"" tasks to show up in widget. Additionally, in widget if due date is passed please show the task in red color. Thank you.",1
"No longer work in Android 9. It can""t load meetings from Outlook or even from Google accounts. Interface is badly designed too.",0
Play tune does not work on gionee,0
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.,0
"It would help me a lot if it could silence the notification from other apps 
when I'm studying",1
Need Google voice integration service to add task,1
This app really is a great idea but for those who dont care about a little digital plant like me it really isnt going to be affective because they wont care if the plant dies. Im going to try to download it again so i can have a little more discipline but other than that i think it is really nice.,1
miss the dark theme,1
UI atrocious! Nothing fits.,0
"cant postpone a task: ""the reminder you set was invalid because its already overdue"" ??? thats the reason im postponing it...",1
I was unable to understand anything..... This app is a big mess,0
Could you please add the option to repeat the tasks?,1
"I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!",0
Easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment,2
Great app. Still waiting for RTL support and sub folders. Please!!,2
It is not what I want,0
Difficult to understand. Bit complicated,0
I have tried various time organizing apps and this one is best till now.,1
"There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now",0
"cannot enter how long a task will take, which severely limits its use for scheduling",0
"Was very happy with the widget, but the refresh button stopped working (outlook 365). Edit: Events from Google Calendar are synced fine. Events from Outlook 365 to mobile device sync fine, but edit them do not sync them back. Manually refreshing from the widget does noting for outlook 365. Manually refreshing in the app works without problems. These are all actions when using the device (Nokia 6.1), and not in battery saving mode.",1
Good,2
the widget freezes a lot. the calendar is not intuitive to use.,1
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.",0
Great app. I just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task/habbit (built-in timer instead of having to open an external timer),2
Nice app for time table and reminder,2
"this is good but, you need to update: where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else.",1
This App is good but the setting is not understandable ... i might not even give it a single star,0
"Looks promising. Would like to see: routine sharing/sync (some routines you have to do with your wife), marking activity as done, have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data (not routines).  I personally would pay a premium for these features.",1
"To me its not user friendly. I dont like the question up front before a tour of the app. Its very limited unless you pay for the pro version. I think, when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from.",0
I dont get any notification when the timer runs out. Please help.,1
"sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked - for instance I might have put the bins out, but not replaced bin bags. on your apo, if I tick the main task, it assumes I have done the sub task.",1
Great app. I wish I had more chance to add reminders without buying premium.,1
Please make it possible to change the start day of the week. I want my calendar to start the week with Monday instead of Sunday. Thanks.,1
Waiting for you to fix the widget issues. Namely parsing @ p # and smart date,1
"Great, I just wish I can move it to another device with out having to by it again",1
I like it because I can keep track of things I need to do. I like the highlighted color it's a good sky blue and it's easy to make lists. It feels good to complete a list that takes a long time to complete. It's good for making for later and good for getting things done I give it 5 stars,2
I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?,2
"The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?",0
Working good so far,2
Appearance good. Sometimes lags and don't update the time even after an hour.,1
"Health widget stopped working after latest Android update. Note 8. AT&T. Interesting take on habit forming. I'm not really a gamer but I like the point system, leveling up, and buying accessories for your avatar with those points. Nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to. (The TED talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too.)",2
"Not impressed considering the size of the owner. Loses entire days worth of data if refreshed as prompted to ""apply update"". Shows lists differently on mobile app. Can't order some lists. Painfully slow to sync between devices when compared to ANY checklist app available. Annoyed since I switched from Wunderlist when Microsoft started ruining it.",0
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events,0
"Interesting concept! Still getting used to the functionality, but this app is an effective way to gamify your to-do and task lists. Before Do it Now -RPG, I had a list of chores; Now I have a quest-list, instead. Time to go unlock some achievements!",2
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",1
"Functional, does everything I want it to do, versatile and allows for both habits and one-off tasks. The only improvement I want to make is changing the colours of the completion status icons.",2
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,2
Does exactly one thing - tracks habits - but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras (or ads). Clean interface. Sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work. No way to transfer data.,1
Very nice app specially you can add sub tasks.,2
"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback.",2
Premium version only,0
Wonderful app,2
All of the free features are really good and I am way more organized,2
"I purchased the pro version in my motorola g5 plus , than uninstalled it, now I can't even get that purchase back! I understand it happening between two different devices, but I'm still using same device. Please help with it",0
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,0
Subscription required just to set a reminder.,0
"Now I don't trust this at all! I learned about the transfer just today so.immediatley thought I'd swop over. Everything seemed fine, I got a pop up to say everything had been successfully transferred. Then this evening I'm just adding something when I get a pop up that the transfer was incomplete! So what do I do now? Unless I cross check everything in all the lists I have how do I know what's missing/not transferred?! OMG! I seriously do not need this right now üò†üò°",0
"very nice app, but there are a few bugs with the widget not really updating to the correct data e.g. - if you put the widget on home screen, change the name of the tasks list, it doesn't update",1
Great,2
"Been using for about a year. Getting more and more useful every day. Works well across Android, iPad, and Windows 10.",2
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.,0
"The only problem I have come across so far is, the day calendar does not change automatically. In order to get the current date on the day calendar is to go to the month calendar and select today's date. That said, the program and UI is better than the pre-installed calendar program.",1
Good,2
Great for organizing!,2
"Exactly like Wunderlist where I came from, because that's being discontinued. Happy I have a viable replacement but sad to see Wunderlist go.",2
"This app is amazing! You can customise your tasks and give yourself rewards in a shop. It really boosted my productivity and helped me get through the tasks that were a bit harder. Highly recommend this app, especially at this time!",2
App has so many problems. I started experiencing them once I paid for the pro version. No one has responded me back from the support to solve my issues. Some issues are as below. 1. Not fully supporting the app whitelist which is a big obstacle in working. 2. Not counting the exceeded time even after setting it up again and again. 3. Took so long to log in after reinstallation as I tried that to solve the above mentioned issues. My advice : Don't pay for this app till these issues are resolved,0
"Loved it.... Awesome for making habbits, Best app for monitering ur tasks and daily routine Thanks HabitNow",2
Can't even add my list straight to the calendar. Wants me to rewrite everything which is annoying asf. Stupid app,0
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",2
Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further,2
Just getting started with this app but so far I love it! Great way to track good habits and bad!,2
Useful. Integrated.,2
"I liked using this app but I recently noticed that important information I had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted. Its happened before and I thought I had made a mistake. But no, it's just this app malfunctioning.",0
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive.",0
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.,0
"Very good app, it keeps reminding me every week to do my weekly review, and that's what I do, can't wait to actually start using it properly tho üòÖ",2
"Closes everytime I try to add a note, event or anything else since last update",0
Very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber. Strongly recommend against this app. Not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails.,0
Becoming undispensable very fast...,2
"There are bugs that break the immersion for me. It's not as responsive as it looks, and the design should be worked out in the app. To complete a challenge, I need to post my goal on the chat, fine. But then I cannot access the chat room through the app, and I need to use the browser for that. Please improve the user xp.",1
easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day,2
"This app is practical, beautiful, fun, and easy to use! Highly recommend!",2
I run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously. A lot of initial decisions had to be made about where I want things and that took a while but now I'm really glad I took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress. Hopefully I can come back and add the 5th star after I've had more time using it!,2
very useful app to track and keep record of your habits,2
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",0
"It works, but i can't sync my goals with my tablet..",1
It doesn't ring to notify me,0
"App is easy to use, but there are 2 features I find annoying. When I add calendar items that I have entered multiple times before, I would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event - even when I'm adding an event for the 50th time, I have to overlay the time, duration & reminder. The other is that my reminders don't always remind me (take today for example) & I would like them to keep reminding me until I clear them, even if that takes all day.",1
"Great for organizing and planning your tasks. Also the app is very responsive, even on an older phone. No wait time, no frustration, just add tasks within seconds, right from your phone's home screen",2
"Ex happy Wunderlist user, disgruntled with this half-baked attempt. Most of the fine details that made Wunderlist great were omitted (with an option to include them at some vague point in the future), interface does look cleaner but there are fewer details that help tasks being organized visually. For a standalone app it would deserve a 3 star. For an app that is supposed to replace Wunderlist it would get a 2 star. For an app that tries to get users by killing it's better competitor, even a 1 star is too much.",0
Very easy to use,2
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?,1
"Kartais kalendorius pastringa,neparodomi suplanuoti darbai,u≈æduotys",1
its ok works for me,1
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...,0
"first time opening good experience. Everything from google calendar was synced, then stacked up my events for the day. Opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank. And you have to pay $7 to be able to drag and drop your events.",0
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.,0
"everytime I snooze an event it disappears.....this calendar is useless. Maybe I did not explain properly....it does not dissapear as in not in my calendar as an event....when I have set a ""Reminder"" alarm at I get a notification pop up, I snooze it for 30min I do not get another reminder in 30 min.",0
Please get rid of all the white space. I have to scroll to read my lists. Give us an option to zoom out or reskin this app to look like wunderlist. Thanks.,0
Love the concept but always keeps crashing... Please do something about it!,0
Best app for habits track and tasks I ever used. Highly recommend! Easy to use.,2
GREAT APP. If you need to keep a list of tasks or develop good habits or stop bad habits THIS IS FOR YOU. PREMIUM/VIP is ONLY $4.99.,2
HabitBull is what I was looking for in a habit tracking app. It has a lot of customization for what constitutes a goal streak and a simple overview and data entry screen. I was happy that premium is just a one-time fee. And it's cool to see the posts from other people working on their goals too.,2
App is good but have some error it's no refresh automatically on widget home screen we have to open app to refresh apps hour line please fix tht error,1
"No background sync. I love the UI and widget, but it won't update notes I create/change from the PC unless I physically open the app, which renders it useless for my needs.",0
"Great pomodorro -like method for staying on task with a built in reward. Whitelisting was free at first, they should've kept it free and added* other desireable features they could've offered at a price.",1
"Great app, but deleted it because I don't like the new Santa hat icon Edit: added a star because they replied and reverted the icon",0
"A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time...",2
"Came over from wunderlist, and i was not happy with the changes, i have sync errors all the time, my lists are doubbled up(the ones i had shared with others) and when i add a new task to any list they go to the bottom at the list so i have to manualy drag them uppwards. AND IF I CHANGE IT SO THAT IT GOES TO THE TOP OF THE LIST, THE APP WONT LET YOU DRAG/ORGANISE THE LIST! THIS APP IS JUST BUGS BUGS AND GLITCHES So in short, make it MORE like wunderlist. But ""OK"" App otherwise",0
Missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app.,0
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.,0
I never leave reviews but this app truly deserves it! Somewhat basic in design (which is very nice to use) and extremely helpful! Love the traffic light feature (most important come first) and the sub-tasks! If you're forgetful or have a lot of little to-dos this app would be so beneficial!,2
"So far, it's okay as task apps go. I'm a Wunderlist refugee because Microsoft bought them out (and they destroy everything). Perhaps Tick Tick will grow on me. We'll see.",1
"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",2
Wonderful app,2
"Horrible now. Was good to start, but now that my subscription expires December 1, cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from Task names. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",0
"Great habit, task and to-do list tracker",2
Cool layout very easy. Push notifications aren't working so it doesn't remind me at the time I tell it too but can't figure why I allowed notifications so probably a bug.,1
Good and helpful but the notification alarm does not snoozes automatically . The notification stays on the notification bar until not removed. Pls keep a limit till after which it should snooze.,2
Sync is not good,0
marvellous! makes a game out of everyday life. helps you organise your tasks while feeding stats about the progress YOU consider important! and the gold-xp reward & punishment system gives some type of extra motive. brilliant i say,2
"Decent app. Fun concept. Biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every-day task, which is very annoying. Sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to-do list for an hour or so at a time, too.",1
"Great but latest update has bugs. Despite having enough coins, when I try to purchase the new weeping willow I keep getting an error saying I don't have enough coins.",2
Couldn't even set up one single recurring reminder without being required to pay monthly subscription. Get your greedy hand off it dev. It's only only a reminder app not a useful service.,0
"A very beautiful app, let down by the lack of subtasks and list item's lack of notes.",1
"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.",0
it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial,1
Can't load,1
"So far, I am in love. This is exactly what I have been searching for to organize all of my todos. The folder feature is the best and I think this will finally bring me into the world of digital calendars. Not to mention the feedback feature is super helpful to instantly get you on the right track with how things work.",2
This is absolutely what I was looking for! It generates my job events Thanks.,2
I am really enjoying this app so far! It's just what I was looking for to keep myself on a routine. And the price is great!,2
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise",1
"It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day.",0
This is just what I was needing! I love it! Only one thing I'd change: please make the colored calendar dots larger!!! Thanks,2
It would be better if there is an option in which we are able to check whether we really followed time table or not .,1
"This app is amazing but after one day when I try to open it, it will just go back to my phone home screen. When I uninstall it then install it again, it will work but I will lose my forest and after a day it won't work again. Please fix this issue, I really love this app besides that issue I'm facing.",1
Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.,0
Do you have any plan to make desktop view? I am using pro and pretty happy except that part. Getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view. A bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot.,2
I would've switched to TickTick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour. üòî,0
Overall amazing.. pls guide me how to amend a single day activity,2
"Loved the concept, beautiful design, and has taken its place on my home screen after a clarification from the Dev on syncing other calendars.  I also love the fact that you can just jump in and use the widget, or you can opt for deep customisation of the look, feel and functionality.",1
Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise,2
Very nice app and easy to use,2
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.,1
Easy to use and functional with features i üíò,2
"Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good",0
A great way to set reminders for birthdays or any type of event,2
Ganky. Couldn't get it to work right.,0
5 stars if option available that will allow tasks to automatically show under My Day for the due date or reminder date scheduled.,1
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?,2
Bestestestestestest,2
"Awesome app,very helpful for forming habbits.Thank you for this wonderful app.",2
Doesn't show a files attached to the event using Google Calendar.,0
"Good app it helps me be motivated without hesitation nor procastination. Thank you HabitNow!!!! Your love, Aliff",2
"Useless. Edit: thanks for replying, I wish the tasks could be repeated every day like in a morning routine that is done everyday to give the user a sense of having a productive morning or something :/",1
"Easy to use, effective and fun. Can't afford the premium though",2
"I like being able to look at my goals each day, review how I am doing, focus in the most important one for this month. I'm seeing improvement!",2
What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.,2
"This app is just excellent! A truly powerful task and project manager. Don't be filled by its apparent simplicity - there are a lot of features and flexibility hidden in this little gem. Try it out! What I would like added though is if the My Day planning feature can be extended so I can plan for the next day, not only the same day, so I can populate my following day's My Day view in the evening before going to bed, instead of having to wait to plan on the morning only.",2
"Idea is cool (not for everyone); I'm removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves; and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen - I'd edit some task from Dailies and after it's saved, I'm placed back to Habits, for example.",1
"Okay if you like planning with Google. It's exactly like that, just prettier. I don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all.",0
"i hated that you cannot edit certain things. For example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots, no obvious anyway.",0
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...",0
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat.",2
"Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled.",0
"Pretty good for me, but in the version I have I can't edit a task.",2
"Ever since I downloaded this app, I've gotten less lazy, I've done more work, and I was able to keep track of my tasks needed. I would rate 5/5 stars, but I would like this app to have compatibility on windows or have some sort of chrome extension. If I am mistaken and there is a windows/chrome extension, please notify me. Thank you.",2
good idea and work i would like to give it 5 stars if you solve my problem im using asus zenfone 3 max and app not able to detect my usage of other apps and plant never withers even if i close the app i give every permission it demands but it still continues im pro version user by the way,1
"Edit: Reply from developer says sorry if they ""offended my feelings""? Really? This isn't a dispute about feelings. To suggest such is a fallacy. Personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model. Original: Everything is extra. 24h mode, colors, any default functionality will cost you more! Bad model! Because they can add and remove features and make you pay again or more. Let us pay ONCE for the app instead of you being sneaky and greedy.",0
"I am the most unorganized person ever, and this app has helped me a lot. I constantly put down when my projects, tests, etc are due. I even include my days off on it. I also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well.",2
"Love this app, the basic version is fine, but I love being able to add even more items in the paid-version! Keeps me on track all day.",2
well I just got it and attempted to.create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it. what gives,0
"Great app! It will be the best app, if developers add an ability to make schedule of pomodoro goals. 10 on Monday, but 5 on Tuesday for example.",1
Easy to use for a big family,2
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",2
"I like it, a lot and also not a lot. I like the way it looks once the tasks are created, but I dislike creating the tasks using the current interface. 4 comments. 1. I have the full version with WhatsApp linked and it causes duplicate reminders. 2. The widgets are not recognized by my homescreen replacement app (go launcher). 3. I would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing. 4. Creating tasks via WhatsApp or Google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous.",1
No email notifications for scheduled tasks! Not good.,1
"I cannot add invitees u less they are in my contacts and sometimes, not then either.",1
Great concept. Store doesn't open though it needs fixing.,1
"Nice looking UI, but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me. Uninstalled.",0
Need to explore more,1
All the things that it advertises that it does you have to pay for disappointed,1
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay.",0
"When I set a task for repeat for a specific day of the week, the app still doesn't repeat the task. I have to set everything manually",0
ok,1
Sometimes quits as it starts,1
This app is good but I can't access 5 habit because I need premium to access it üôÖü§∑,1
"So far I love it. You can turn your life into a game and reward yourself for everyday tasks. No life coach can do a better job. You earn gold and XP for daily chores. Awesome, and so far no issues.",2
"I used to love the app... Until I needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device, then I found out syncing simply won't work and uninstalling/reinstalling didn't solve the issue.",1
"Decent app, very helpful to split things up visually but several issues over the past few months of usage. Tasks suddenly stop syncing up from a desktop PC to the app, deletion of lists seem to work but then the lists re-appear, and most recently all the tasks that have been completed over a period of time are suddenly back in my list. On a basic level, this app is useful, for anything more than that it's not the solution I was hoping for. I am a little OCD but if you are too then look elsewhere",1
Love this app. My favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks. Quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage.,2
was great but the last update stop synking the outlook account... try to re-connect it but no luck...,1
It could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive. Why should I set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app?,0
Everything thing is customizable but there is no timer i want timer for every sub task that i create every single task i do i want a time and daily stats for the same need to download some other providing the same for now when you include this mail me i will download again!!!,1
Good,1
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside,0
Does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails,1
"Love it, some pay features are annoying",2
"I can't share my lists with my partner because I'm told I'm using a work or school account, but I'm not. No such problem on wunderlist.",0
Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,2
"Wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy, but now ads take over the entire screen",0
"To finish scheduling a task, you must click a small arrow in the top left corner. Clearly, the development team never tested this becsuse it feels horrible.",1
It was ok,1
Very pleased with the product! I do however have one suggestion: possibility to pick location directly from the maps would be nice.,2
"Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above.",0
Is there any way to link the planner with your laptop? If my phone breaks or is lost will I lose everything in the planner?,2
Works fine for importing calendar. Can't say same for tasks. OS: Linux,1
it makes you rate the app and its extremely annoying.,1
"Edit: Initially gave it 4.5 stars. The app itself still works fine, but the sync stopped working about a year ago. That's the main reason I paid for the premium version. I messaged the developer about it and never heard back. Wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer?",0
"Cant add widget to home screen. Configured the app, added task list and tried to drag the widget to home, shows up nagging popup to select theme etc. Does nothing even after configuring the app. Won't recommend it.",0
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",0
Great way to start to get organized!,1
its too complex,0
"The minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me. I had hoped to use this as an exercise timer (I need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e.g. 3m/30s, 3m/1m, 5m/1m) plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on TV. I'll keep looking.",0
"I love this app, it's the only one that looks and feels like the old Franklin planner, however; since the latest update I have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with Google ads and I am a paid pro user. This is extremely annoying. If they don't remove this, I'm leaving.",1
"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",2
My favorite thing is when to do list speak loud the task to do. Is good not having to read your screen. I unistalled because I miss this feature,1
"The big CONS to this app: DAILIES tab always shows all of my weekly duties, instead of the DAILY ones. I change this in the filter but once I reopen the app, it switches back to showing EVERYTHING. What's the point of a filter when the app doesn't save it? (Galaxy Note 8) Also, why is there no dark mode? My eyes are screaming at night.",1
"Cannot share lists. Send invitations from both directions, to lists imported from Wunderlist. On both sides, get ""Unavailable List""",1
"A nice, userfriendly application to organise our To dos and reminders. But please try to add a seperate smart list and a widget called ""Today"" (and ""Week"" too), to view all our To Dos and reminders with today as due date. This is available in Wunderlist. Because of this one feature I would prefer Wunderlist, when compared to Microsoft To Do.",1
"Continue to get Sync error on this app only. Can use web and see tasks. Cannot figure out how to fix. I've uninstalled this app sever times, logged in, logged out, stopped app, cleared cache, etc. Nothing corrects it.",1
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. üòï. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,0
"Decent app. Would try premium, but not going to pay yearly, almost $50 for it. Offer a monthly plan and I might try it.",1
A blue flag ?,1
Great app to track habits. Helps to keep me motivated.,2
"Had a great experience when I was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone, it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application. Even with the same account. Please work it out, I would love to keep using thru my phone.",1
Good Develops app ‚åõ‚è∞üîè,2
Es great. Good enough for me to use it to help fix my sleeping pattern.,2
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,2
I like this apps. But I would like it better if it can show event description.,2
This deserves 5 stars. But I am not able to see discussions since the last one week.,1
"Honestly, this app is not user friendly, is not intuitive. When I try to schedule a repeating task, it's confusing. After selecting a task to be repeated, I am asked how many days?! What the heck does that mean?! How the heck can I SIMPLY set a task to be repeated every day? Developers, where's the user guide?",1
It's a really good app if you're trying to focus on somethingband it's definitely helping me with my studies for final. The satisfaction after you see that the timers up is awesome and works great if you use the reward system for focusing.,2
"Good but could be better. It works well and is very similar to Wunderlist, however it's very annoying that the reminders disappear from the notification bar if you haven't completed your task in a day. So you have to reschedule every day. Would be great if this could be fixed.",1
"I uninstalled the app and installed it again and now the app works, but ive lost all my progress and my forest... this is so dumb this app forces me to uninstall and then i dont even get my progress back",0
After the update widget stopped reacting but after deleting it and reinstalling it worked again and then came back to same problem.,1
I accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away. How do I cancel? I go into my subscriptions in Google play but I do not find this app among my subscriotions. I suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over. Pleas confirm how to cancel. Thanks//,1
How to equip those new purchased trees??????,1
The alarm doesn't work,0
"This app is fine but after sometime it won't open and I don't know why. Besides this problem, it works amazing. I would have given it 5 stars but I'm giving it 2 just because of the problem...",0
Nice,2
Needs an In-app Guide to make the user understand how it works. Update: I really appreciate you responding and working on it. Thanks,1
"It was good for a few days, but now it's not loading on my browser at all (Gateway timeout), and changes I made on my iPad are not syncing to my phone. not useful if nothing works.",0
"App worked fine till they put in the new username update, now there's a bug where you can't get into the app because every name is taken",0
Still the best by far and even better with online sync & backup. This is the first todo list I've ever paid for and been happy to do it. I love the granular approach to organisation so you can get as complex as you like. I use it every day for just about everything.,2
"I like this app very much, because it's fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used; not just notification tones). However, my biggest issues are that I cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone's calendar (I'm assuming this is the issue since only half, or less than half, of my total events and tasks do not sound). It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times. It's original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time, but I changed it to be on time and then I would make other reminders if need be. It will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time, no matter what I tell it to do.",1
"Hi, I really love this app so I bought the Pro version. However, when I click on the button to sign up nothing shows up. I was hoping someone could help me with this issue to correct it.",0
"Since I linked it with a smart watch I've been able to make the most out of everyday, which is huge since I used to do nothing due to indecision. I've scheduled time for both professional stuff, self-improvement and working through my backlog of movies and games. Super easy to use too, and good backup support (I switched phones and all my routines were imported). Solid app.",2
"Easy to use, effective and fun. Can't afford the premium though",2
"Although limited, still useful",2
"Review Update: the scheduling function I wanted has been included at some point in the past (which I did not know as I stopped looking for it long ago.) So... I am now pleased and revising my rating! Original Review: This app is good but I do not understand why they do not create a way to make a recurring (annual) event for, say, the 3rd Thursday in July. One can only create recurring events on the same DATE weekly, monthly, annually. That is not how many events are scheduled in the real world.",2
good app that does it's supposed to. wish it had some improvements to make it great (suggestions in the in-app forum),1
Too complicated to save and add.,0
When you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time. If I could I would rate this app 0 stars,0
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoy√© a l autre...,0
"It was fine until I found that to use features like syncing or transferring lists from an older app I had to upgrade to and pay for ""Premium."" Felt like bait and switch.",1
"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.",2
Such a cool app with deal breaking bug. This calendar app could be perfect for me but notifications simply refuse to work.,0
Brilliant and incredible app. It turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple RPG concept. Love it!!!,2
"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project.",1
It is good sometime app does not work properly. Intimation not shown on time.,1
"This app is very useful. Minimalist, yet almost everything is available. I could group my activities sub-activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly. A calendar option would make it complete.",2
I didn't use yet,1
"This app really helps me even if I'm not studying or hanging out with friends! I like that you have too set a time for how long you want to do things, but I wish that if you wanted to leave the end the time you would have a withered tree in your forest. Other then that, I think the app is awesome!",2
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling...",1
Like,2
Widget sering ngadat dan ndak update dengan hari dan jamnya. Butuhnya pasang widget agar terupdate tapi seringnya malah gak cocok dengan waktunya. Notifikasinya pun sering g muncul.,1
It has a really useful ability to add sub-tasks to other sub-tasks. Great to use for ordering tasks.,2
"Please use the app the widget, and see for yourself if ur comfortable with it. Compare it with s planner.",1
"Good concept, works fine , helps to avoid phone addiction. But the problem with this app is that it crashes everytime when updated. Several times I installed and then uninstalled it. That led to loss of data and time. Tried your way , not available in my device. Problem still persists.",1
"5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under ""productivity"". Already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments. Please rethink if you want to go the ""standard"" way you mention, or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users. I'm in favour of ads in free app versions, but this is too much!",0
I love this app but I wish free users could do more without a membership. Like at least they could be able to see the leaderboard... ://,1
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",0
It has a nice pop up widget for your to do list. The problem with this app is when I want it to alert me always at 9 about it or remind me of my tasks it doesn't. Its just there. I'm still using it but i feel google assistant does a better job of reminding me. So I might delete it later. Not so satisfying.,1
Remainder app for free? That‚Äôs what I Thought this app was. Please don‚Äôt waste our time it is very disrespectful. For you to get people you say it‚Äôs for free the app and it‚Äôs not for free. Please don‚Äôt do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies. Lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy I don't want to open no more apps I don‚Äôt trust what they say,0
"Great app, I like recording tasks verbally.",2
"Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it.",2
Highly motivating and helps to organize and track progress.,2
"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!",1
"Worst , battery consuming app",0
"Great app Thank you so much and love u {Forest: Stay focoused} App developers because you do a great work for humanity, great application for students and other person who want to analysis your work time . i love app so much once i get a job i buy a pro version. Thank you developers.",2
Not free,1
Good,1
"Its honestly a great app, other than the fact that it keeps pushing for me to upgrade and i cant do certain things unless i upgrade.",1
"What I am missing the most is, that I can¬¥t open it directly in web browser just with my login without installing anything. In big industry companies is not alowed to install anything, what is not fully authorized by central IT department. I used Wunderlist in my browser (app in chrome was possible to install without any permission), but I can¬¥t use it now in my work browser. Just in my private smartphone. By transferring wunderlist tasks some old and completed tasks are transferred as uncompleted. So, 3 stars for now.",1
"The best scheduling app I've used so far. Easy to view at a glance, and connects directly to your calendar. No complaints.",2
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.,1
"I've tried different calendar apps for a few years now and this is the one that I have decided to keep for the longest time. The monthly view is very neat, event creation offers a lot of option, and colors are easy om the eyes, too.",2
Too many long ads,0
App is very buggy. Completed tasks keep showing up as not completed. Notification alarm won't work. Uninstalling.,0

"This applications are, all there setting up you routine for the day and you can set appointments in advance.",2
"Thanks forest its a really great app. But, sometimes when I am not connected to the internet it doesn't work. When I want to plan and push the button, nothing changes. And this really bothers me cuz i love this app and its a really crazy problem that I want you to fix it. Tnx again",1
Overall good. A search feature would be great for notes. Thanks,1

Great app but isnt optimized for google Pixel 3xl. i cant re-size the widget to match the size of the screen.,0
Make more advanced settings for paid subscription not the color of the theme.,2
"Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.",0
"This app has helped me stay off my phone at work. Instead of randomly looking at my phone and getting distracted, I will plant a tree to grow for an hour and when the hour is over I look at my phone for 5 minutes then plant another tree. I get so much more work done because I have a reason to not get distracted.",2
I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.,1
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",2
"Okay better than others but the design should be material! Some features are to pay, less than the competitor but still i cant use fully for that",1
C'est tr√®s bien... mais √ßa devrait √™tre moins lourd en daya,1
"Good app. I agree with other reviews, the addition of tasks will make it great. Update: The new edition seems to be less useful. It seems one need the pro version to get it to work well.",2
Used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until I found out that none of my trees die when I switch apps. Tried all the instructions in the FAQs section of their website but nothing worked. Great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone.,0
"love it in my wear device. Wish it had current weather, daily weather on it... even if paid feature. Best wear face for busy people!",2
"Paid for pro since I use this app almost exclusively. All my other calendars are integrated into it. I use it daily for events, tasks, and reminders.",2
Doesn't allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers don't even respond whether on email or twitter.,0
"After paying for the pro version it went all good for a few days and now it doesn't even open it says ""forest keeps stoping"" i tried clearing the cache but nothing.",0
"Worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders. The reminders would pop up if I opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder. Also, froze a lot. Pretty much useless. When it worked, it was excellent.",0
The sync feature doesn't work.,1
It's completely a mess. Can't understand what to do and where.,0
"Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one.",0
"this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one",1
good,0
I had the app for the past two years. I opened it after around a fortnight and it did not open. It just kept crashing. I tried re-installing the app but it still kept creashing. But it was an awesome app when it used to work.,0
"It's such a helpful app because I always use this so that I can become more productive and finish what I have to do on time, it's also helpful because it helps me remember what I have to do.üòÉüòÉüòÉ",2
"I LOVE IT! This app us so simple and easy to use, it's so clear to see what needs to be done. I love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists. I also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date. I LOVE IT :)",2
not exactly useful. was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable.,0
Very bad app,0
tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app.,0
"Very nice app. Could be very useful, but unfortunately does not sync. :(",0
"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30.",1
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.,1
"Amazing app. Very helpful in planning your business. Very nice feature that you can add something and put it on repeat (every day, every month, certain day...) Highly recommend, it will help to make you business and life more easy.",2
"It did improve over time, but still needs things like ""every other day"", ""5th (or last) Friday of the month"", ""every 3 months"", etc. Went back to ""Tasks & Notes for Office 365"". Much better. I'd this gets THAT good, I'll be back.",1
Good app. Effective at reminders. Easy to use and read. Looked at quite a few task apps. Happy i picked this.,2
"i found that, if i am reloading the app from recent apps it is again asking for the password. quit a nice feature . even some important apps are not having this feature. but say if i am switching to another app while seeing some habit chart. when i see in recent apps, i can clearly see the last viewed chart. it would be nice, if u guys can fix this issue",2
"In love with this app! I use it everyday,  all the time. I have bad memory, so this app always helps me at keeping track of things!",2
"Great app! Intuitive navigation, easy to use. Nice integration with other apps. What's up with the lavender color designation?! I didn't think that lavender would look turquoise.",1
"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",2
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!,2
"Fantastic app, it helped me develop a good study habit of remaining focussed and taking positive breaks in moderation.",2
Why should I pay for an app of which I haven't installed? Huhüò†üò†üò†,0
"The new ''double reward"" feature is very upsetting and cheapening. The whole point of this app is to help you focus and reduce phone distraction, not barage you with ads for developer profit",0
Great app,1
not great. why can't you put the total number of days completed regardless of streak?,1
It's ok. The free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone.,0
"The widget in one line mode could shorten the time spans so they don't take as much space. Also it doesn't seem to sync well between multiple phones with tasks.    *10/22/2018 edit* Not sure how else to respond to the dev but it's task syncing not calendar syncing that's the issue.   *10/23/2018 edit* both devices have task syncs active, and are just the main google account",1
"Beautiful app... l LOVE the functionality and look...however, it won't sync with my Android phone. (l use it on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 ) Unfortunately, this shortcoming really affects me, since l now have to enter everything twice: once on my tablet, then again on my phone.",1
"Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.",0
"App is great, it's simple enough to use. What would be great is the ability to add in a password protect function for any notes you enter in. Also 1 thing that annoys me (hence the 3stars) is that I find more often than not that when I type words, the preview screen truncates the first 2-3 letters and replaces them with dots. ** Developer very quick responding to feedback =)",2
Excellent app,1
"Using Google Pixel 2 and paid for full version...sometimes the day on the calendar doesn't update. I dont want to have to restart my phone everday. A workaround would be to press the refresh button on the calendar, but i dont like having to do that every day.",0

"It's no Wunderlist. Needs a quick add button on the app's home screen. Reminder notifications disappeared when I opened the app. I dislike that I am forced to use Microsoft account to use the app. Other than these issues, it's alright.",1
When planting tree with exceeded timer count on ... The tree doesn't get planted even after the set time ! Please fix this.,1
Good concept but lack basic functionality,0
Just starting using it but i already LOVE IT!! It is an amazing app and it is so helpful.,2
"Great, handy way to stay organized",2
I want to schedule a task daily ! Should I add it every day ?! What's the way ??,0
"Purchased the premium, the app stops sending notifications after some days, I have to repeatedly open the app to get notifications, waste of money",0
Microsoft version of Wunderlist. Lists can be shared and sync'd between users. Needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position.,2
"Terrible, Wunderlist worked well, nothing seems to work now, transitioning was not easy, I had to set up an account I don't want and don't need. I am not happy, Microsoft has not done well with making things user-friendly for some time now, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't start stealing everyone's information and using it without ""consent"" like apple does. Oh wait, I can't tell the difference between any of these companies now, and I am pretty sure they all do that and don't care! GFY!",0
Nice app but how to put red color?? T-T,1
"Great list organizer! I've used any.do for several years, and frankly I like the organization and features of Microsoft To Do better. The only feature I miss is a total task count. Microsoft will likely add it in time.",2
Clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore :( :(,0
"Finally is working, but I had to erase the data on my cellphone =/ Later I'm going to check what happened with the avatar. Until then the rating gonna stay still",1
Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.,1
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep,0
The app does not work. I can use my phone freely but it seems like a great app. Also there is no instructions for LG phones.,1
This habit tracker is fairly good in its own right but there are ways it can be improved a lot. Perhaps it can be more specific. Perhaps it can become more addictive with certain rewards for teaching certain goals.,1
Only get about half of the reminders,0
"Love the app ... was able to download it to my iPhone. I went to download it to my Samsung tablet. BUT once I hit open, all I get is black screen. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work",2
Seriously? Reminder is a premium feature? What's the point of all this then? 1 star. I can understand comments and labels but reminders? At least other paid apps give reminders.,0
not easy to use....always begging to buy pro version.,0
Buggy. Flickers and won't let me scroll to bottom or won't let me select. I want Wunderlist back! It was perfect!,0
"Great format and tracking. ¬£7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget... Also, people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion: can that not be reflected in the app too, for inclusivity? Removing forum comments would be a great option: an unnecessary distraction.",1
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.,2
It's fun and easy to use.,2
Very nice app.,2
"ive been using it up almost 2 years now. its a good app - which I always recommend friends and cowowkers to use it Few suggestions: - update the sort ( for task lists) , so we can sort by other filters - for team tasks, probably add the chat feature",1
Terrible app,0
"I really like this apps, it is so easy to use.",2
"Update: The accidental deletion problem described below is compounded by my now finding a ""confirm before deleting"" setting that simply does not work. The app is nice, but when starring or opening a list item it's easy to delete it. That's because deleting happens when you slide an item left, and that can happen by accident. Either add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of deletes, or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items.",1
Time zones not supported? Missed a meeting today... :(,1
"Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help.",2
Good,0
Amazing app,1
I really wish the calendar was available for non-premium members,2
"Love that you can have multiple lists and also that you can reorganize the items on your list. When you complete an item, you can either check it off with an automatic date stamp or swipe it off completely üëç. This app has a very easy learning curve and I'm sure it probably has even more cool things that I have not discovered yet!",2
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me.",0
"I like the simple interface and it helps me set reminders for tasks, schedule them and analyse them.",2
"Can't see new topics of discussion. Also can't add discussion topic even though I have excellent internet connection, Wi Fi or Data. Please fix. I have no connection issues with any of my other apps.",0
Best to do list app I have used,2
"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself.",2
Thoroughly enjoy it and not too intrusive that it becomes a chore in itself,2
"Very good, could have a little more utilities for the free version",2
too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store.,0
So far it's been very helpful & useful for simple lists like groceries & things I need to remember to pick up for my daughter.,2
"Spending $10 once or $5/year for a subscription would make sense to me; but paying $15/year to use a to-do list (when discounted) is really excessive. This is a great tool - actually, I love it; but I find it ridiculous to pay so much just to TEMPORARILY unlock basic features like a calendar. Edit: Since writing the above review, I've found cheaper/free alternatives. The one I'm using is called Treat Yourself. It's free and doesn't look great, but it serves my needs just right and I love it.",0
"Microsoft forces you to use your Microsoft account to use it, then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications. Sharing via text feels like I'm back on my Droid phone, and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well. Also can't customize ""smart lists"" that are stuck at the top. My Day and Tasks? That's the same thing for me, either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them. Microsoft took Wunderlist and ruined it.",1
"love it , simple to use",1
"The app doesn't sync after making changes on my Google calendar, even after hitting the sync now on the app",0
"Unable to delete a list. There are no ""3 dots"" on the top right hand side of my screen. I dont have all the features it says it has. I loved my Wunderlist and tranferred everything to Microsoft To Do....not sure I will keep it. Looking for other options.",0
"It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day.",2
useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity,0
I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.,2
It's working anymore after paying for premium,0
Still learning. Looking good so far. Nothing to complain about.,2
Not as good as w√ºnderlist sadly.,1
I bought pro version and paid twice. Still haven't been delivered the pro features.,0
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its ¬£3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,0
The link provided is the same robot answer I received by email. I still cannot download the the pro version I bought as it was removed from the market. If you remove it from the market then obvisouly no one can download it. And if it is not removed. Provide the download link. Else do not tell your customers that it is a perpetual license. Did you ever hear about short links??,0
"i like this app but one thing that i hate , why do i have to be member of premiums ( i mean why do i have to pay ? ) if i want to track up more than 5 habit ? this is a free app right ? please can you consider or change something about it",0
Beautiful üòÜ,1
Very good experience. Does what we need.,2
This App is really is the best . It helps me to do everything on time and keeps me organized. This app has really easy set ups too .,2
"1. Apart from events, how to import Reminders from Google Calendar App? 2. How to import the tasks from Google Tasks App?",1

Excellent calendar I use it regularly.,2

"For the Samsung Note 9 newest OS update. Customer service FINALLY figured out the problem. And it worked for about a month. Then Samsung sent out a new OS & the reminders are firing even more randomly than before. Just emailed tech support AGAIN. I have to say, I do love the app & tech support is good, but response time is slow. But unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with, I may have to find a more Google friendly app.",0
Too hard to use,0
Wow! I tried many apps like this. And in my experience this app is the best one! So easy to use! After other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect! You just click '+' and enter the name! That's all! Of course if you want you can add time and date and something else. I recommend!,2
Motiva a mejorar es brutal est√° aplicaci√≥n,2
"WOW I REALLY LOVE THIS APP!!! Such a great idea. I first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility & organization, we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress. I generally enjoy this game, it is the only one have on my phone.",2
Widget I add on home screen doesn't work when I'm offline.,1
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it",1
"It doesn't let me use it, it keeps saying forest has stopped",0
"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. I would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case. Thanks!",2
Adding function of goal list eg. the work has a goal and the goal shall finish in which days.,2
"Not worth! When i use other apps it keeps the timer on. What's the reason behind it god knows! I can't even get other species of plant as bcoz as soon as i try to do so.....

"The last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working. The company that owns it seems to be a scam. It was a great app, I paid for it and got no support",0
Alarms are singular and not like an alarm clock...,1
Very good. Sometimes aggressive advertisement.,2
Very clear and easy to use app. The paid version is so worth it. Having your daily schedule displayed on a clock is SO nice for my ADHD,2
"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",1
Alarm not working .. so no time strict,0
"I got a newer phone and I used the same email that I purchased the pro app on, but it won't let me install it again for free when I've already paid for it.",1
"Best app ever! It keeps track of your habits and, if you turn on reminders, it also keeps you accountable of the goals you set. Simply genius!",2
"This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.",0
This cannot sync Outlook :(,1
It's great showing visual how much time I have and what time I use. I needed something like this!,2
awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys,2
"First time and first day was everyting amazing, but the next day for several time it showed the ""connection error"" message. I loved everyting in the app, very visual and fun, so when this issue gets fixed i will come back to give more stars.",1
Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,2
Limiting sections is ridiculous .... so if you want to add things for 30 days you need to have seperate projects.,0
It's cool but now I can't use other apps as I used to. So i have to delete the app cause i always use many different apps while studying. That's sad,1
Nice app & very useful,2
"Great app!    Help,  I unfortunately forgot my password (I was very sure it's correct but I'm not sure why it says it's wrong). Is there anything that can be done about it?",2
"im sure the app is nice, but i cannot add a routine, or any activity, nor i can delete anything?",0
"Wouldn't it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications? It's easy to miss a notofication. Also, why can't we edit a specific day for a repeated event, but we have to edit also all future events or nothing?",1
Good job,2
Excellent! Very versatile. I like being able to set multiple reminders and the location.,2
"An app that is simple to use, and well-built, speaking from everything I've asked of it so far.",2
"Would be 5 stars, because it's really great, the best calendar I've ever used, but it keeps losing things I enter where I have poor reception. It's like it thinks it has uploaded them and then forgets them somehow.",1
"I got Taks to replace Todoist. Later, I deleted Tasks and went back to Todoist. Still not happy, I brought back Tasks and now run both apps side by side on my phone. Perfect solution. Todoist carries the heavyweight must-do daily work load. I refer to it two, maybe three times a day. But Tasks is there to be fleet of foot and versatile - a quick list here, a few to dos there. Adding to and ticking off right throughout the day. That is my way. But Tasks would be a great stand-alone app too!",2
I can't arrange my habits in the order I want. I have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical.,1
Only been using couple days. So far so good. Easy to get the hang of. Some functionality aspects could be enhanced but overall v glad to be with this app.,2
All my tasks are gone and unable to load anything.,1
"I really like how this app is working. It's easy to use and routines are very useful. I had little problem and I got a response in one hour, so thank you for the help!",2
"while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one.",0
"This application is good in a way that you can prioritize and organize your tasks. The thing is that, the important features such as the 'alarm' for notification of reminders and sharing of documents are only allowed in premium package and as a student I would not be able to avail these features monthly.  I wish that you can add a feature wherein you can personalize your notes so it will be more fun and exciting to use.",1
"Cool app, but I wish I could see everything I own at once. When I get a new item, I have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went. Confusing for new players. Also, if you don't have a party, it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer.",2
"Seems pretty good, but totally crippled the free version by not allowing reminder notifications. What's the point without those? Not bothering with it.",1
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me.",0
"I used to love this (five stars) before you changed it. I was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week, but now if I set a repeating task today, for example, for every Wednesday, the reminder will come up today, not Wednesday. I want the reminder on the day I want. I am very disappointed. By the way, I won't use Any Do for my grocery list. I use a better one that keeps a running cost (including tax) for each store I go to.",2
Lower rating until I use it more -just started,1
"uninstalled, it interferes with my normal Google calendar.",0
This app deleted my whole google calender,0
Helps me to stay focused,2
"I liked it ,nic one. thanks!",1
"If time tracking was added and the parser/interface of the ""what would you like to do?"" field was fixed (this alone is making me want to switch back to Amazing Marvin), I would rate 5 stars.",1
I downloaded the app and it worked fine only once....the second time I tried to open the app....it stops by itself.... I tired uninstalling and installing again.....the same thing happened again.... this is the 4th time I had installed the app....it worked fine once and again has just stopped working.....it wont even open.,0
It's great,2
Love the app... Very powerful. Used it for 2 years.,2
"Bad experience with the subscription, they refuse to give back the months I haven't used after canceling. Just want the yearly subscription. The Mac app crashes / gets stuck.",0
I think its a nice app. A nice initiative,1
Very customizable and easy to use. Works great with Google calendar but I can't get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account. Bummer!!,1
Very good. Considering going premium.,2
Nice app It helps a lot to save time. You will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time.,2
I have been using forest since 2017 and had collected over 3000 coins. Unfortunately my phone got stolen and I had to buy a new one. Now when I reinstalled the app it's saying that I need to start collecting again and to log in I need a premium account which I have never had. How can I get my points back? Thank you.,1
This provider will spam your email box with no option to unsubscribe. Beware.,0
"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.",0
Great for neat month view. Unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders AFTER the event? Not good.,0
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!",0
"Great app, but annoying that it limits the number of lists you can make. I can understand limiting *shared* lists on the free version, but not regular ones. Functionally it's great though. I would pay a one time fee to open the pro functions, but not ongoing fees.",2
It work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with Facebook servers? Adguard noticed it,1
I lost all my pictures that I had attached in wunderlist.,1
It's alright.,1
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great",1
"Beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however I wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick. Update: no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up....too bad I loved it",0
Great app. Unfortunately the price for the cloud sync (the only premium feature I need) is rather high,2
"App hasnt synced in 190 days. Won't let me log out. Still loads all my old data from last sync. Hasnt been updated since 2018, that should be the best clue. Dont buy!!",0
"This was originally a 5 star app, but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or Facebook! üò°üò°üò° I am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app. Would give it zero stars if I could.",0
Love this app. It makes viewing all my Google calendars in one apot easy! My only issue is entering locations because I live in a rural area and it recommends places in large cities all the time.,2
"Coming from Wunderlist, I am disappointed. So much wasted space in the user interface and no way to make elements smaller. The overall look is also less slick. It really is a ""to do"" app while I'm looking for a listing app. Will have to find an alternative.",1
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional.",0
Its a best app for doing every thing,2
"Plz help, it says m typing wrong passcode, it is not opening with my old passcode",1
"Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update.",2
"In microsoft todo, there is no such option like in wunderlist to comment on assigned task with others and others can get notification on their mail, kindly add the feature if possible",0
"It's an interesting idea, but this app missed some extremely important features, namely: a landscape mode, as well as a custom notification sound. Why? Those are extremely easy features to add! My use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so I can charge it while at work. I want a custom notification sound at work, and I want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait. Also, I keep the screen on, and the app disses me because I have the app open.",0
A good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events,1
"wont synch to calendar, have to buy pro version",0
Would have given more stars if the add folder option was not removed from the original Wunderlist To Do List. I also used to be able to take photos offline and they will be automatically uploaded when I'm online. Now I must be online to even use my camera. I also do not like the idea that when you add a new note or something it stays at the bottom. These notes should automatically move to the top like how it did in Wunderlist. Otherwise the App is helpful for most of what I do.,1
"I would give this 5 stars, if not for the misleading in-app ""smartwatch settings"" extension purchase option. I love the app, but I purchased the extension to use it on my galaxy watch and I have been unable to connect it to my watch and use any of the settings for a ""wearable"". If this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches I would love to know how.",1
It is good but not for me,1
The app stop responding for many days already! It is disturbing that it stops after 5 secs whenever i open the app - STILL STOPPING,0
"Love it! Lets you make multiple lists and lets you move items up and down to prioritize. Most useful out of several ""to-do list"" apps I've tried.",2
"Great app to plan out your weekly schedule, especially for a college student. However I wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget. It shows it when you go into the app but that's less convenient and helpful if you want to do a quick check to see how much time you have for today's lunch break.",2
"I like this app, It is an amazing tool, however I couldn't find calendar and where I can track what I have done. Could you help me find it?",2
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It‚Äôs super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!",2
"Like the app so far...but I went into the settings and changed the appearance of my ""Standard View"" to Month...yet everytime I open the app...the standard view shows Day instead of Month.",1
Great app and so far no issues using it,1
"Updating for 2020-still the most important app I use. It's been life-changing. ---- Todoist is the most important app I use. It's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks, make lists (weekly menu, shopping lists), collaborate at work, and keep track of my kids' responsibilities. Doist is an ethical, bootstrapped company with a customer-centric vision and a regular release schedule. If I could marry Todoist, you know I would.",2
"While the concept is good, the app doesn't work. In my case the app doesn't detect if I open other apps so my tree keeps growing even if I open other apps. Also I noticed that I would reach for my phone more after installing the app. It may work for others but not for me.",0
I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.,1
"Great app but why do you need 13 Ad trackers in this paid for pro app? Exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous. Using this every day, but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times. Edit: You inform, so that makes it okay then, for you. Perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere. How do I confirm the trackers are not used? Trust you, I bet.... 13 are for revenue, 1 will suffice for personalising.",0
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient,0
It is a good application. It is very useful. It is just okay.,1
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist,0
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app,0
I found that the several tabs was unnecessary and prevents me to be productive. We have to pay for an app to get reminders. I'll rather use an app with ads if the reminder function is gone,1
"So I forced myself to sit thu the first exercise and I want my 25 minutes back, please? Is this a joke? The devs must be sadomasochistic to develop an app that flashes conflicting phrases such as ""Stay focused"" & ""You can do it!"" with ""Don't look at me!"", ""Stop phubbing"" (l had to look that one up) & ""Put down the phone!"", not that I was using a phone in the first place. Quite extraordinary!",0
You block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if I won't to continue.,0
Love it makes sures I do my task one thing to fix can you make a section where we can save our list in case we get new phones,2
All I want is a calendar. This app spams you so much. 1 star,0
It's okay,0
I'm so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out.,0
"Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8",0
"Cancel means stop the action...not throw away all the notes I just made...sorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planning...poor comms from app on a normalized UI function. First go and really turned me off, could be lots more awesome, but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly then...not acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays.",0
Very useful and and easy to use,2
Easy to use,2
It is not what I want,0
"I wanted to delete one item, pressed a millimetre too low, the whole list is gone. About a hundred items lost. This alone makes the whole app unusable for me. Months later: still this same fatal flaw. Seems like MS have no interest in improving this app, sadly",0
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y",0
Really great for staying organized! Super easy to use.,2
This app is great for staying on task. The interface allows you to leave and access your documents while still allowing you to have your focus timer on. This app is so Awesome!! I genuinely love this app. I hope that more people would download and experience its greatness.,2
"I can't allocate skill points? While it's not something massive, it 
certainly is a little frustrating.",1
"So far, this app has had a profound impact on me getting things done. It does rely a bit on the honor system, but if you're down for it, it can be very good.",2
Are there any guides out there?,1
"Does the month view as per the ""Professional design"" image exist? this seems ideal but i csnt find it.",1
I think it's great however sometimes I would like a better tutorial like how can I personalize the sound of one item in my routine.,2
"Just trying it out. Seems like a great app but has a really, really basic miss that I saw referenced in another review: Theres no intuitive way to specify or change the time of a task. Tasks are all just all automatically set for 9 am and theres not visable button or option to change the time. The other user mentioned trying to use Google to figure out how. But such a basic miss seems like a flag that maybe I should try a different app.",0
its not working in my op6 properly ..i am not able to access the full functionality of task in notification area...looks like a bug,1
"Limited unless you buy the full version. I spent time looking around trying to work with the app. A lot of things I tried wanted me to upgrade, which is why I found another.... I feel my review is fair. Sorry.",0
"Excellent - This is even better than Wunderlist which I really loved, they've taken it up another level. Brilliant cross platform tool for managing all my tasks",2
"Now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out, however would think should see them in overall list, but not on widget....good but could be just tad better.",2
I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,0
Exceptional!!! Works perfectly.,2
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits,1
It's one of the best time management app... Just love it.,2
"It is an okay app, but it keeps logging me out once a few weeks for some reason.",1
Yes this is a great app. I like all the different variations and things I can tailor to my own needs.,2
Its great,2
"As far as calendars/task lists go, it's pretty much the same as every other one that's any decent. What sold me on purchasing this app was the crazy customizability of the desktop widgets. However, I'm still miffed about the crappy, out-of-date icons/emotes the devs are using, and that at least one of them all but refuses to get with the beautiful present with them (I use icons to quickly identify types of events on my desktop agenda widget - very useful).",1
not work in my tab Lenovo yoga 3 bed experience üòëüòíüòû,0
"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs",2
"It has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and I am writing this review as gratitude to the developers. Though, many of my favorite features have been added to default Google calender app, this one still is my default. The diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks. Another feature that I had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks, that have helped me in forming few good habits.",2
"Awful hard to start, impossible to figure out",0
No Doubt This is a Great App but it is now causing errors. App Crashes all the time when i completed my first session of Study. Now I am Facing very much Problem.Kindly work on this issue,1
"Don't lock reminders behind a pay wall, or if you do, make it a 1 time purchase.",0
"Got this when I realized I got most distracted from my work by looking at my phone. Really helps me focus when I need to. I didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case I actually needed to use it for something important, but I don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff. Also I like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get. It makes me more motivated to use the app. I hope they add more season-themed trees (snow covered would be cool!)",2
The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.,1
I have tied a few calenders. This one is good for multiple accounts. Easy to turn them off and on. Its quite clear on a phone screen,2
Good,2
"Genuinely I have tried a bunch of different to do apps and this one is by far the best. Genuinely has every feature that you'd want, you can organise things in so many different ways. Big props.",2
Don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times!,1
"There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now",0
Good app but needs to add daily To do List,1
"It is good app but when I update it, it stopped working",0
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.,0
"I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",2
"Well, I downloaded it, liked it and bought it. It didnt disappoint me after a long time of usage. The one and only app I have bought and probably ever will buy. Thank you.",2
"There's a very important feature missing ‚Äî to SELECT AND EDIT MULTIPLE TASKS at once. Also, the app could improve speed wise. It feels a little SLOW and HEAVY, specially with the transition animations. Otherwise, 5 stars.",1
I love Artful Agenda!!! It is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone! love the new featured that keep rolling out!,2
Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,2
"I liked wunderlist much more, I can't arrange the tasks in the list freely. It looks like there is something wrong because I can arrange some lists and couldn't for others, and the starred list which is switched to important is just a long list, I liked how it was divided before, it is really disappointing.",0
Ever since the new update that came out today I have not been able to use forest. Every time I try opening the app is says forest has stopped. Is there any way to fix this?,1
"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.",0
Usless,0
"I'm using this app for quite some time, it has big problems which forcing me look for another app, it doesn't remind me on time, all the reminders work when I open this app at that time it was too late.. What the use having this app.. Please correct this problem or else I am happy the all the options and features.. Thank you",1
"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. ¬£6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!",0
"Ok, I guess.",1
I really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so I can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features.,1
Its a fabulous app. really easy to use. Fun as it offers colourful background,2
"Great app, but why can't I add an attachment? I need this functionality and although I have been using BC for years, I might have to go to Google calendar..",1
No search option. Mixing up of completed and incolplete tasks in list. Mismanaged,0
This app was exactly what I expected to organise my time. Thanks.,2
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.,0
I wish it wasn't conected to Google Callander which I don't like at all.. Overall realy awesome concept. Wish I could use it... If only it was a Callander on its own.,1
"I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.",2
No longer able to add note to Todoist quickly using Google and Note-to-self. Yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds. Not sure if this is a Google change or a Todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on Todoist. I am a LONG TIME premium user looking for another tool.,0
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.,1
"App hasn't been updated, can't sync, can't import habits, this was a good app, shame that I have to switch",0
"habit syncing not working on paid version. app is great, but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost. And the app is showing i don't have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection. But other than that app works great , the widget is great and i use it daily.",1
Good - the only thing it has that isn't on my Samsung cal is Agenda view. Crappy- My SCal has dark mode. BusCal - you can basically F off if you're vision impaired. Font size & dark mode are paid only. Not fun to test drive in the bright white light. UNINSTALL...,0
A great tool to see what's going on in your day. I linked work and personal calendars into one. The customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to.,2
"Have been quite satisfied with Premium for a year. Would have been so good with a monthly/weekly calendar view for my TickTick tasks, like the web app has. No calendar icon, although the doc vaguely states that there is. Guess it has been removed. Well, it still has a tiny edge to the competition.",2
There's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons. Please fix it!,1
still testing,1
Too many bugs,1
"I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!",2
need to increase some options of task editing,1
Went for the premium subscription without a doubt. Definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly. Edit: Everything's good but after changing phones I've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work.,1
Must have this App,1
I loved using this app but now it is not working at all*I can't sign in even after paying!!,1
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.,0
"BEWARE the trial period is a scam I've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad. After 5 days I realized it didn't quite organize my information how I best work so I wrote to cancel. They informed me that I must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict Terms cannot refund me. So I wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the Ad, but they said it's not possible. Really?",0
App is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app. Evertime i need to log out and again log in it. Plz solve my issue,1
i think you need to improve the ui... and the ui names. its really confusing.,1
"Missing some key features - having the ability to have the same task in multiple lists, and an 'undo' button to undo completions/deletions done by mistake.",1
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.,0
"Great app so far, very user friendly. Would love an option to duplicate a hole list (found an option to duplicate sub-list only). Thanks!",2
Wunderlist being killed by Microsoft.... Seems like most people are coming to this app instead of moving to the recommended Microsoft To Do. Giving this a try.,2
This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,2
"Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.",0
Most of the things are paid,0
"good app ,but some feature are to be updated still like, it should actually calculate the petcentage of work done by us on each task and should be more attractive i think so",1
Does not show reminders,0
Increase very good,2
Great!,2
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.,1
Dear developer. I'm unable to view my calendar events in this. Why it happens? How and why its happened.  What is the alternative? Otherwise I would give 5 stars.,1
"My original review seems to have disappeared. I have an issue on my Galaxy Note S8 where I can't turn off the alarms without uninstalling. I received a response from support, but couldn't respond directly. Their response was simply that I should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away. Yes, I agree, that should happen. However, that isn't what happens. There is no notification from the app for the alarm. I receive other notifications from the app. Running out of room to explain.",1
"Really well for procrastinators and forgetfulness!! I constantly forget things but this keeps me on track. I will admit though that the tags should have an option on sorting them (clicking and dragging them to be in a specific order) other than that, perfect app and no issues so far!!",2
"Not only is the app bad, the second they have your email address they start spamming you. --- Response. Hey Doist I have a better idea, quit taking people's email information and spamming them without their permission.",0
Though I would love to see it make improvements,2
Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..,1
Awesome,2
"Used to love this app, but the new widget is ugly, unreadable, and too easy to accidentally check something. I'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out.",1
ok but need to improve,1
"Haven't come across a better app if it's type. It's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder! It's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool. The notification, repeat, export control, is brilliant. Really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting. I've tried a lot of applications, this is second to none!",2
Can't make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like Google calendar,1
Terrible app,0
"I used to love this... now on my phone it's oddly presenting and tasks are worthless, no syncing, and just too much work. Seems to have been since last update. Support I was given was also unhelpful. Went into actual google calendar and realized it hadn't been syncing for 3 plus weeks Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Half way working but now its showing I dont have premium (wrong) and wont let me access. 6 hours now... big ""pro' stamped across app. We shall see how long until my next contact.",0
awesome,1
Extremely useful once you get a hang of how it works.,2
"Pop up notification (alarm with voice) is not available. Please do needful. Check to do reminder, it will help you to make your app improve.",1
Long time Wunderlist user here. What I feel that can definitely be improved is the snappiness with which each task list opens - right now there's always a small loading delay when clicking on a given list.,1
taking stars off because no swipe options. that's just so bad sorry to see that. get back to your previous designs please,1
This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!,0
"Perfect widget for your home screen, all your events in the same place on a clock.",2
The user interfaceis not good enough. It is not that much understandable,1
"Deleted review accidentally. 1. I create habit type tasks: the ones that repeat regularly. I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh. Just don't pretend you care, be straightforward, like, 'we won't do it in the nearest future, not in our plans'.",0
Doesn't go to portrait,0
"Its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother, or a way to access it on a computer or browser.",2
Compared to Google Tasks it's overly complicated and too many menus to set simple things like dates and times.,2
"I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.",0
"Doesn't import anything from my calendar despite my calendar being ticked as a source, so pretty much pointless. I'm not double entering everything.",0
"I Like the clear & unclutter look, everything is organized..wished i could export it without having to pay extra.",2
This is an amazing app that helps the environment and helps you stay off your phone. So really its a win win,2
"Neat, but I don't put that much stuff on my calendar.. Looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines. Don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar.",2
"This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.",2
Helpful,1
"I do like this widget a lot however I left two stars blank for very specific features. First and most importantly I left a star empty for the ability to display battery status on the widget as I use this as my primary smartwatch face. Thus without this feature it is very hard for me to see the status of my battery at a glance and know when I should try to get a little bit of charging. The second feature is integration with Outlook calendar without asking for permission for the entire account if it needs to ask for permissions at all, as my workplace has very high security requirements. For each of these features implemented I will add another star.",1
Like the new Schedule page,2
"Great support, ads were displayed, dev had it fixed in a day. Thank you, and great product. it's the closest thing to a Franklin Planner I have found.",2
"Amazing app. I use it to track everything from art projects, bills, grocery lists, even my food counter!",2
"The recent UI changes are not intuitive. And the snooze options still suck. Why can't we have a simple 3-digit numerical entry field, plus a period selector with minutes, hours, days, months, etc.? The Life Reminders (LR) app has much better snooze options, and time/date entry options.",0
"Sure could use a ""completed tasks"" tab. I hide my completed tasks in tabs as it just gets messy and when I wanna check what is done, I gotta manually untick the ""hide completed"" and then tick it again. I'd also appreciate if you could see when the task was completed. Overall a great multiplatform tool, been using it since I found it.",2
I liked it but the due date you can't change only the due time. Also getting the feature up for the due time is hard enough so going to try a different app.,1
I prefer Wunderlist since you can move around the tasks but app doesn't allow that flexibility; only broad sorting features.,1
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for....",0
"I purchased the pro version but i changed my phone, so the app says that i have to purchase to log in. What should I do?",1
"This is a decent time managment app. The ability to create routines is handy, though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping. The most recent update (as of 3/30/2020) made the app look much cleaner, which is nice. I would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app. Choices now are very slim. The $5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it (yes, buyer's remorse), so if you can manage fine with the free version, stick with that.",1
It has a nice pop up widget for your to do list. The problem with this app is when I want it to alert me always at 9 about it or remind me of my tasks it doesn't. Its just there. I'm still using it but i feel google assistant does a better job of reminding me. So I might delete it later. Not so satisfying.,1
"I would really like to see the inbox feature in Wunderlist brought over. There is currently no efficient way to quickly add tasks so you can sort/organize them later. On the main page, there is only an add list button, and I don't want to add everything to My Day. This gets cluttered and messy. It would also be nice if tasks that you have assigned for a certain day are automatically added to My Day, instead of having to go through and look for tasks that are due and add them to My Day manually.",1
"I like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done, everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks,i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit,therefore i won't plant trees, i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't.It's rly a problem. please fix this! Tnx",2
"Sorry this is not a review but a question : anything I enter in google calendar ends up in any.do, but not the other way around ? How do I do this ? Have I missed something ? Specifically, I want my Goggle Home mini to be able to tell me what's on my any.do tasks and calendars.",1
"Is there no way to have weekly rasks, but only week days? Other apps have this option...",1
"The app is good. But it has a bug, i use poco f1, in desktop widget, it many times stop showing tasks, just shows a black empty list. When we remove it,and add it back from widget list. It works for some days,but problem keeps on occuring times and again. Please fix it.",1
Updated to the latest version and the store would not load anymore plus my trees planted for the day does not record anymore,0
"""High background usage"" Sorry, can't waste my battery spyware like this",0
I want to be able to set so that the week starts from Sunday. Highly inconvenient for I frequently set the reminder wrongly. A day behind. Please upgrade so that the week start from Sunday.,1
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS,0
"I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics! If they were a bit more high def, it would be amazing! we could finally see the equipment customization better - more motivating to continue using and complete tasks.",2
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!",2
"I really love this app. With my busy schedule it's so great to have all my day's events plotted out in one great visual. BUT, it drains my battery like crazy! I've lost 10% just typing this out. I have to un-install it. Please. Find a way to fix this so I can re-install!",1
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.,0
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",1
Latest update broke sync and my lists are all out of whack. I live and die by my to do lists so this has completely ruined my workflow.,0
It is a good apps but I can't open it since the second times. It showed it had frequently crashed. I need to uninstall everytime,0
"Pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once I've gone back to a long list I created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version, so annoying. Don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list",0
"Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug",0
"Good functionality and integration with Gmail, alerts work as they should. Have used it for nearly 6 months with no problems.",2
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more üëç",1
"Intuitive, flexible, and free from nagging ads",2
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,2
Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.,0
"Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!",0
"love it!! so helpful, works really well and is super cute. i just wish the different trees cost less coins",2
"I purchased the premium version and now I can't buy new plants, errors keep happening and I would like to go back to the free version without loosing my forest. I have the newest version so it should be so glitchy. Once it's fixed it will get 5 stars.",0
okayish,0
niceee it help me alotp,2
App signed me out and refuses to take my password. After resetting my password I log in and then they tell me there is a problem with my account and to go online to the website. Not user friendly and quite frankly annoying.,0
"It is inviting, which makes it very usable.",2
"its a great app in general, just want a couple of tweaks that would make using it more streamlined. The biggest thing is I have goals that increase incrementally every day, I would love to have a way to have a yes or no that shows that incremental adjustment. Also, when inputting numerically set goals, I want to be able to just start typing the number and have it replace the default 0.0 without placing the cursor and backspacing to enter a result. Still, the interface is otherwise great!",1
"I have looked and looked for an app that would let me make lists and check them off like pen and paper, and this does that. Simple and great to use.",2
"When i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when I add notes to a specific date. It might work fine if you don't need many events, but it's a pain if you have a lot to keep track of",1
Good,1
good,1
Great and simple to use..,2
"It's really cute and motivating. But what I'm missing, would be an option to set a tree to be planted at a specific time.",1
Love the app... I would rate it 6/5 if calendar exist,2
"I like this app but I give only 3 stars because I am unable to bye new plants , whenever I go to Store to bye new plants it always load , loading never stops and , so I was always unsuccessful to bye new plants. Please make any solution for this problem so then I can give you 5 stars",1
Really good app and well built with nice user interface. They also have good customer service and they replyed quickly to my earlier review where I was experiencing a problem at first.,2
"It really helped dude, I have online school and since there is no teacher to scream at me I delay my work but never seem to do it. But thanks to this app I'm planning everything and I'm slowly getting back in track. Recommend to all students out there",2
Perfect app to maintain your habits in good paceüòé,2
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!,2
Pay to remind??? Really???,0
Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.,0
"Why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can't even check/uncheck it via the widget? Its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list. Other than that, this app is good.",1
Great app when it works but don't assume you will get any support when it doesn't. Always read our help files and that is it.,1
Waste of time failed to pair with mu gmail account...gave up after 5 attempts,0
Keeps clossing,0
good but not fully free,1
"such a scam.....!!! first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder ,once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features üòëü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs",0
"it is fun. every time i get an egg/food/potion though, i have to drag down the spinning wheel to let it reload üòí",2
Easy to use and keep my tasks in check. Love that I can have different sub tasks for different projects though i wish they could vbe color coded so as to differentiate them,1
"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly.",1
"Seems like it could be fun, I just had a hard time getting into it.",0
"Ticktick throws a lot of functions and features into the app, almost the whole kitchen sink. It has some very good and strong features, specially related to reminders, recurring reminders, some ability to recognise natural language dates etc. However it needs to improve MUCH more in search abilites. Except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type. Search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work. Robust solid search is still sorely lacking",1
"Seems like it may be a good app, but I uninstalled as soon as I found out you have to pay a monthly fee for recurring reminders (which is developed once and costs nothing to maintain)",1
"Loved it...until the projects feature was going to cost me a yearly fee. 
Honestly, I wanted to try it and see if it works for me so you lost me when 
you made the features I wanted cost.",0
"I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.",0
"It's slow to update and pretty buggy, but it's a good idea and helps me and my friends maintain accountability.",1
Going great so far,2
"++ BUG: confirm to delete doesn't appear after swipe to delete action, but does appear during select item/menu delete. Shouldn't it be the other way around? (easier to accidentally swipe) Or for both? ++ pls add animation to indicate syncing progress so we know when we can force quit ++ pls add option to add tasks to top of list ++ sorting seems random when choosing to show completed tasks; shouldn't all completed tasks be stacked under non completed? Or is it chrono but we can't see it?",1
Love the simplicity and design,2
I much preferred Wunderlist!! Could easily copy items to new or existing folders. Was much more versatile!! Why do IT techies have to move 3 steps back each time something new is launched?!! Surely R&D of products they wish to replace should have shown functionality used?!!!!!,0
Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.,0
If u want to study you need to plan DON'T USE APPS,0
"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.",2
"This app is exceptionally great. I wanted to shift on Google tasks due to it's integration all over the place but this app is also cross platform compatible. TickTick is 1-2 steps away of being the ultimate app for daily task, habit management tool.",2
Good app for management,2
Love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days.,2
"Great app for tracking whatever it is that you want to develop as a regular habit. Clean interface and very easy to set up new habits like exercising on set days, not smoking or taking medicine. The 'streaks' length & percentage success are good motivators and give you a nice visual reference for how well you're doing.",2
good so far. only used a few times may review later on.,1
A great way for a visual person to outline and track their activities,2
"I like this app as it helps to track things that are important for me. I'm still exploring how effective the method is but I like what I found so far! It'd be nice to have a way to see the correlations or tendencies among habits if any. Good job, nice idea!",2
"1/ I'm very happy I paid for the app - I've used if for a couple years continuously now, and it has never let me down. 2/ This layout is excellent for taking my days schedule in at a glance. I highly reccomend trying it. 3/ The widget has pride of place on my homescreen, and my Android Wear watchface. The designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget, without confusing or overly cluttering the display. There are many useful customisations that I found easy to control.",2
Excellent - Thank you. I appreciate you having a free version without a time limit.,2
too tricky. complicated ..not immediate.. maybe isnt what i need...i need something more simple..,1
"App did not properly import all data from Wunderlist as Microsoft claimed it would. All of my 'created dates' for items in my list got wiped amd set to the current month day and year of when I did the import a couple days ago. This would seem to be a simple table record to grab from the Wunderlist database, to transfer over to To Do. I would expect a cleaner and better QA'd experience from a company like Microsoft. This is as of build #151.",1
"I absolutely love this app. First of all, it actually works and give me all the motivation I need to get stuff done. Secondly the community is awesome and there is just so much stuff to do! Recommended to everyone looking to develop habits.",2
"Good, simple app that works well. It keeps my to-do list synced between my Android phone and web browser on my computer.",2
"I love this app, it's the only one that looks and feels like the old Franklin planner, however; since the latest update I have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with Google ads and I am a paid pro user. This is extremely annoying. If they don't remove this, I'm leaving.",1
Tick Tick has been very easy to use and very handy. I use it for both business and personal use and find it very easy to collaborate lists with other people and create lists,2
"It very easy to use, but we should be able to merge tasks for all accounts in one location. Changing account from personal to work or school is really annoying. I once lost all my data when my school account became inactive!",2
This app is good but it works only once or twice a day and then crashes a lot.Need to reinstall it to work again. Please fix this bug.Else i would have given 5 stars,0
"User-friendly. STEPS and GROUPS are smart features! Options for repeat reminder are comprehensive. Love the colors! Suggestions: 1. Retain THEME COLOR for TASK. So when opening Planned, easier to distunguish which tasks are under Acads, Orgs, etc. 2. A better font style for tasks. 3. PLANNED. Please classify Next Week to specific days. It will also be great if I will be able to move tasks from Today to Tuesday next week with a press, hold, and swipe. Automatically updates the due date.",1
"Parece una gran app, pero no se me actualiza el idioma a espa√±ol, a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea. Una lastima",1
"I used to love this app because of its theme, but the new skins totally kill the app",0
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.,0
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.,0
"The best Android calendar app for power users. However, since a year or so, it freezes with almost every use, making it practically impossible to use. Not sure if this is a widespread problem or just me. Support has been responsive and has tried to reproduce the problem, but in vain. The option of sending a logfile for analysis is unfortunately not available. A pity, as it is a great app; I still haven't found any other remotely as good as this one.",1
Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.,1
"yeah, this is not user-friendly. there should be some kind of tutorial, this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using, which is what I was hoping for.",0
"This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.",0
Would gladly pay for this if it was Outlook compatible.,1
"Right after installing, I noticed that whitelisting apps is such an important and basic feature which you made available only for premium users. This is such a ridiculous decision for a ""google play editor's choice app"" that im not even gonna bother trying your app any more than 1 minute. - Update: No it's unacceptable that your development team didn't predict the flow of new installations and didn't include any kind of trial period, but fine i'll up my rating to 3 neutral.",1
"There are glitches in the Android app that aren't in the web app. (I love the web app) Would give this 5 stars if Todoist fixed them, and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed. Dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task, or just reorders back to original placement after I drag it to a parent task. The @ and # symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as I type like it does on the web app.",0
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated.",1
This is one cool app. Not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint.,2
I dont understand anything. it's super complicated,0
"The app didn't work for me at first, but after uninstalling a few times it eventually worked, and I love it! This is great for me as a college student because it makes keeping up with homework and assignments easier by adding an element of fun!",2
Money hungry devs want about $5/mo for simple features... That's about $60/year for the fully functional organizer app. Other than that it seems nice so far.,2
"My experience of being on wunderlist was far superior, at least you should have replicated the look and feel. Why kill Wunderlist?",1
"Love this app to stay off my phone while working, it really helps in only using the phone if it's really necessary. It's super motivating to watch your forest grow",2
I just started using it. So I'm not sure how good it is yet. I do really wish you could do bullet points like: * - - That you could check off. It would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list. & That is currently what I need üò™.,1
"This app doesn't let me log in to my previous account. Once I skipped the initial registration page due to some network issues, I tried logging in but it only shows Sign Up or connect to Facebook which I definitely don't want to use. When I use my previous account on Sign up it tells me that the email is already taken. Please fix this issue.",0
"I was looking for an app that let me make todo lists (for my lazy self) that met the following criteria: 1) Something that looked decent. 2) Something that let me set reminders in case I needed it. 3) Something that's quick, easy, and intuitive to use. This app is all of the above and more. I'm speechless from how amazingly simple and nice-looking the app is. I love being able to set custom colors. If only I could have it on my computer too! (Maybe widgets in the future?) Well done, Steve :)",2
"Microsoft forces you to use your Microsoft account to use it, then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications. Sharing via text feels like I'm back on my Droid phone, and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well. Also can't customize ""smart lists"" that are stuck at the top. My Day and Tasks? That's the same thing for me, either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them. Microsoft took Wunderlist and ruined it.",1
Good replacement for Wunderlist. Missing the possibility to create to-do by sending email.,2
Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,2
"Awesome App, if you could add undo feature : if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo.",1
I love this app it's very cool. I'm having fun with it. ü§ó,2
No subtasks,0
This has replaced my paper planner (and I am addicted to it)! The most amazing app and product ever!,2
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.,0
Great app. Very user-friendly and practical. Thanks,2
"Hi, today the editing or deleting of events stoped working. When selected to be edited the event opens in a window without it's name and if you choose edit the window closes and goes back to the calendar. Also by swiping your finger on the list it can not be deleted. I really love the app, it's has worked perfectly so far but like this it's useless, please advise. Kind regards, Marta Santos",1
"Can we have the lists back at the top of the page like Wunderlist, I don't need any of the options that take up the top half of my screen!",0
"love the tracking, love the accountability. I use the widget, but I dont like that you can't split habits into ""profile"" type structures. for example, an ""AM"" Routine list of check offs, and a ""PM"" Routine. maybe those and a list of habits you just want to complete daily at any time. that would be a game changer for me. I've considered other apps because of that one missing feature. I dont like how the widget groups every single habit Into one list. I want to split habits up between multiple.",1
"""Hey, want most of the features of our app? Then you'd better pay us $30 a year!"" -this app Response: *laughingly uninstalls and writes this review so I never mistakenly download this again* Just greedy! ""But our on-going server costs!"" I don't need cross-platform sync, and that's not an excuse to hold basic features like notifications and start-of-day planning hostage. Consider a 1-time unlock for all non-server featues and we can talk.",0
"Love this app, has really helped with sorting out school, work, fitness, and study time into my schedule.  Only reason it isn't a 5 star is the lack of a watch face for my Galaxy watch.",2
I just download this app and it was so cool and helpful. It helps me to stay focus and use my time wisely..,2
Extremely appropriate for those who enjoy time management ‚ù§,2
"Hi, i change ""start day of week"" in the sitting but in the repeat option, when i check the ""skip weekend"", the program skip saturday and sunday!!! if first day of week is Saturday, then Thursday and Friday are weekend, please fix it for 5 stars! this is very important. thanks.",1
Dark mode - done. But why on earth in 2020 I still can't rearrange my sticky notes??,1
The only drawback of this app is that you need to add events or tasks or routine to your Google calendar in order for it to show it in the app. It would be great if such events could be added on the app itself.,2
I have no problems with the app so it must be working.,2
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",2
"Love hate relationship. The app is great.. It nags and nags and @*! @@! nags per your settings until you want to kill it.. Dead!! And then again! But it does its job. The reminders are rude, intrusive, nagging, annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list. I HATE it.. But it's supreme for procrastinators, busy people, air heads, and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target. Phone/setting dependent",2
"Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible. Those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games, but stopping what I'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable. I understand the banner ads to keep it running, but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far.",0
This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,2
"I'm in skyrim! Nah, but all jokes aside this app also has the benefit of suggesting healthy habits, which would be good for a lot of people.",2
It never reminds even thought I've set the reminder,1
"Missing obvious feature, take a photo and set a reminder. If it had that i wouldn't use google keep anymore. Even Evernote can do that.",1
It miss my data after updating.i can't use it easily.,1
"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.",2
"Really nice app that is easy to use. Would be cool to see a feature where you can build things, like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks/habits",2
why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience (say if i accidentally clicked + or - for a habit)?,1
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient,0
Lite useful and great,2
Good job,2
It is good aap for making daily routine chart..it help us for work and remind important,2
"Absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until you've downloaded it and signed up. Too bad, it looked pretty.",0
"Too much configuration, not very intuitive, I'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day, not to set goals, reminders, notes, and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen, not looking for enterprise app just for personal use.",0
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.,0
Love this. This is a fun way to build your self up,2
Did love this app... But since the update. I seem to lose tasks. Now I do not trust the lists I have created.,1
"I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.",0
updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.,1
gaada waktu kapan harus selesai.. jadi kurang detail,0
It seems to be improved  and noted no option to delete routines and need to go all the days and delete...,1
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.,0
"This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.",2
the app is good but the customer support is awful. I tried them a few times asking to transfer my premium account I had on iphone to my samsung phone but got no reply whatsoever.,1
"Lots of unnecessary notifications, the GUI is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app, like splurging only every X days (but no less).",1
"For anyone who wants to manually order your list, just long press the task and drag/drop it. It's really easy. My 3 out of 5 is because the widget seems broken. I have a large 3 x 3 widget to see my Planned tasks. The list randomly disappears in the widget. Open the app and it's still there. Go to the widget it's still missing. Randomly it comes back. If this gets fixed, it'll be 5 of 5.",1
I'm not going to even explain why one star,0
Good app,2
Wish Microsoft could copy Wunderlist features properly before killing it. I am already missing Wunderlist.,1
"Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****.",1
hi love the app so paid to remove adds on my phone but they are still showing on my tablet how do I remove.,1
Paid for premium. Does not sync.,0
"Tasks:ToDo is a work in progress. Nevertheless, it is very handy, and I am happy to have it. (I'm a former Wunderlist user.) I believe the app developer will continue to tweak Tasks: ToDo. Not that it's not helpful now. I do miss the deleted items not being ""hidden"" under the category of tasks they came from. This was very handy for shopping (especially groceries & other places I shop for), I could peruse my completed list for things I may have forgotten. Thanks so much! Continue the good work",2
My entire plan was suddenly removed,0
The app was last updated on 2018. Looks like the devs abandoned it. I've been having trouble with reminders (a key feature of the app) but haven't heard back from the devs. :/,0
nice!,1
"Very Nwice Hi, How can I sort my todos according to due date? Is there any way I can team up with local players? Also is any offline version coming up, just to check off tasks? Thanks.",2
Good habit tracker,2
The free app is too limited. Other than that it's a good one!,1
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it,0
Decent mate,2
Simple straightforward app,2
Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.,0
"Firstly, this app often has been stopped. I've tried to do something to fix 
it, but failed. Then finally, this app has been blocked by my phone. So sad 
can't use it.",0
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move",0
"No way to integrate with google assistant on a pixel. It's great app by itself, but unless developers figure out a way to make this happen, this gets one star. At the moment todoist has a work around, but ultimately, im just looking for something that allows me to get thoughts into a task list without needing to search for my phone and get into the app. Sorry devs.",0
"Has good potential. You guys should allow the app to display the date when 
a task is due. For example if I have to remember what day something is due 
(i.e. haircut appt Wed, 7/25/18)",1
I didn't know how to do anything..,0
"I'm really happy with this app - it helps me stay productive, both in school and with my writing goals and even tiny things like just getting out of bed in the morning. I 100% recommend this to anyone who procrastinates as much as I do, because it's really helping me get out the hole I dug myself into with my bad habits.",2
Easy to list things and good reminder!,2
"Please, solve the problem with fast typing! After I type in the date, letters and numbers REMAIN",2
Paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again,1
Nice app ..want toThank bro who created this.,1
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited.",1
I like this app. It's very useful.,2
"I click undo but retain the XP. No real theme or this app, very bland. Needs character",0
"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!",0
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.,0
"I have been a Wunderlist user for years. When Wunderlist announced they were transferribg to a new platform, I started looking for options. I chose Tasks because of its high rating and it has lived up to its rating. It is very easy to use. Unfortunately, I could never get the Wunderlist download to save on my phone so I have had to reenter everything by hand. But it is doable.",2
Great app,2
How to See my completed tasks ? I am confused as I accidentally clicked on done and tasks stopped appearing on the list Obviously. But It creates problem cuz you didn't do but it checked. So please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month . So we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes. Thank you. Other than this small part This app is best for me. I am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature. üôèüôèüôè COMPLETED TASKS LIST UPTO A MONTH,2
"This is a great app for my needs, I've got one issue, but not sure how to explain. It's when I look at my daily events, and click on the day, I can't get it to disappear, so I close the app.",2
"Pros: I loved the visual representation of events and Integration with Google calendar. Cons: It isn't integrated with Google tasks. Most of the users would use Tasks to track their activities, along with Calendars. I would love to purchase the Pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with Google Tasks.",2
Love it.,2
I used to love it. It was my go to app for many years. But over the time it is losing the special status. It doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times. They removed that!,0
"App hasnt synced in 190 days. Won't let me log out. Still loads all my old data from last sync. Hasnt been updated since 2018, that should be the best clue. Dont buy!!",0
"Useful. But constantly calls out to access crashlytics, Facebook, etc. Too much spyware. I'm searching to replace it. App also locks you in so you cannot export to another app.",0
I use free version and its useful for everyday tasks. 4 stars because there are too many ads.,2
Should help you more,1
This is the best app ever!.... it helps me manage my time when im doing my online homework and not get distracted!! I tend to procrastinate a lot of times so i know for a fact this app is the best,2
This is really helping me manage my time and daily activities. Wonderful app!,2
"Repeating tasks seriously need to be automatically added to 'My Day' view on their due date, each time. It would also be useful if there's an additional option to automatically delete completed tasks, instead of just hiding them.",1
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.,0
"so far so good! relatively easy to use. I was really hoping to be able to check off routine items when completed. trying to build up on habits. so it would be great to be able to track completed progress. calendar sync in pro verson went seamless! however when i go to change a routine item because it conflicts with a calendar appointment,there is not option to just edit that one Tuesday. its either all Tuesdays or no Tuesdays. It would be great to see date options & completed progress tracking",2
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy.",0
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me,0
"it was good until the recent updates. i installed this app because of its widget. however, the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised. there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings. i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be, maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting, but it's not as good as before. im disappointed",0
"I wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down. I wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar, unlimited inventory etc.. (and the subscription for themes, sounds and other cosmetic stuffs)",1
A lot of work to make this app. Wonderful for good habbits building.,2
"Have been using this app for years and have loved it. However, a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it. I do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years. But with full screen ads, NO, sorry.",0
"Seems to work great for me, but my family have trouble accessing the app, having to log into their Microsoft account EVERY SINGLE TIME. Get it together, Microsoft... it's frustrating and ridiculous.",0
"So far it's not flexible enough for me. Also, there needs to be an option to remove 'general discussion ' from the dash board. There seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and I just don't need to see that when I'm trying to inspire myself to play more music. I'm going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as I haven't given it much time but I can't see me using this.",1
I really like the app but I can't use it until calendar view is available and subtasks become visible from tasks level.,0
"Love it overall, but I had the worst time trying to get it to sync initially. I ended up installing the Google calendar app in order to get my Chromebook to sync on schedule, and then BC2 worked just fine (must have been the Chromebook?)",2
I love the app and ended up buying pro because I wanted to save my coins to plant a real tree. Why is there no option to watch an advert to double coins on Pro version?,2
"You guys bought Wunderlist and I changed to TODO. Why are killing a great app, like Wunderlist, and replacing it with an unacceptable alternative?!?! You have fallen short. I cannot invite anyone to share lists. I have been very patient while you fix the invitation aspect but after months I am looking for a replacement to Wunderlist, which I understand you will kill in April, as well as TODO.",0
Piece of poo,0
It is not working,1
Well pleased with this app.,2
"This is a good app for forming habits. However, it is missing important functions that you'll need. For one, this is primarily a countdown timer app. It only counts down for a specified time. It would be better if I could have a stopwatch feature. I want to use this app for times I'm working out. Also, the minimum time allowed is 10 minutes. They should change this. Either way, I uninstalled. Ads suck too.",1
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",2
"Nice app if you have tons of calendars from different accounts and still want to be able to see a selected subset of them. A bit annoying with the pro version advertisement as of recently. Please, let add a feature to remove the tasks panel, I don't use it and can't resize it. It takes 1/3 of the day view.",2
"Now I don't trust this at all! I learned about the transfer just today so.immediatley thought I'd swop over. Everything seemed fine, I got a pop up to say everything had been successfully transferred. Then this evening I'm just adding something when I get a pop up that the transfer was incomplete! So what do I do now? Unless I cross check everything in all the lists I have how do I know what's missing/not transferred?! OMG! I seriously do not need this right now üò†üò°",0
"Bad experience as the events created (Ex: Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc.) in Alarm mode is working only sometimes!! In such situations, the event is just turning ""Red"" (but Alarm is not ringing) as if i missed the event...!!",0
Great app! I use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses I take for my masters. The free version is perfect enough for what I use it for.,2
Great but when you set a target date it doesnt remain as is and shifts to another day for that month.,1
great app .. keeps things organized. my request is that changes should be saved automatically rather than having to press save like in google keep. i forget to save it before leaving the app usually because i am in a rush and so things don't get updated.. this feature would help a lot,1
It was decent but I remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress. Not very streamlined.,1
Bough the premium subscription for 37 AUD. Worth every penny. Made a top firm list of things I need to sort out this week. Was wondering where to start for past couple hours. Checked out Google. Creating a group for myself in whatsapp to remind. Astonightly undoubtedly worthy. New whatsapp integrations let's you to be reminded whenever you set it to. Chartbots to the win!,2
"Fun cover, stickers and layouts.",2
There is a glitch in which it do not keeps track of your hours of study My target is 5 he's and if I studied for 1 hours than I add it and poof next day it shows 8930 hours,1
You cannot check off when you have finished a task in your routine. üòê Also a tad confusing. Tags are cute.,1
"On my S9+, it's started giving notifications some minutes after the event. It actually states it, e.g., ""4 minutes ago."" The time delay varies. I hear the notifications announce on time on my Huawei tablet.",1
"Very useful app, gives reminders, easy to set up.",2
ItŸ¨s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable,2
Very nice app I like the fact I am able to log in any type of event in the calender and track your progress.,2
"Confusion regarding 'sharing' your schedule with other team members or subscibers. Seriously, would it kill them to put an 'added', 'enter', or some kind of 'task completed' button... it would save a lot of confusion. Sending an invite to fellow workers results in a vague link that seems disconnected with the original intention. No 'Connect with Users' or anything other than a link. For something that's supposed to be time management related, I've wasted hours trying to figure this out.",1

I really like how amazing it is on my phone. But I'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch...,0
"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.",0
Useful app Convenient interface,2
This is ok!  But it required bunch of upgrade and some new features!  Will keep it! But wait till is it perfect!,1
The app is good but reminders don't seem to be working.,1
"Exactly what i was looking for, a way to set up and visualize my weekly routine",2
This app is simple to use. Reliable for daily use. It helped me much to do my tasks.,2
"Really helpful for making me stay focused on studying, I think the guilt of killing a plant is very motivational. However there was a weird bug, during finals week I was using this app for hours straight but then it suddenly stopped working. When I click the plant button, nothing happens. I left it alone for awhile and its okay now but I wonder why it happened. I also really like the store and think its very motivational.",2
After using many other like app finally i decided to return back and use this.very composed app is developed,2
I don't care for the dashboard,0
LOVE THIS APP. I use this to consolidate multiple work and personal calendars in one view. I love the ability to manage appearance and notifications for each independently - super helpful in maintain work-life boundaries.,2
It is a fantastic apps. But if they can allow the push reminder in the free version it will make it perfect.,2
"I love Wunderlist! Unfortunately it will disappear in May 2020 and be replaced by this app. Me and my husband have installed the new app, imported all our lists from Wunderlist but we cannot share any of them, not even the ones that we previously shared in Wunderlist. I hope they will fix the problem until May.",0
Good,2
I'd like to know how to create home screen widgets.,0
The best Mobile business calendar ever!,2
"Does not refresh on Samsung phones. I have done every troubleshooting step and more, to no avail.",0
it s great,2
The new full-screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable. I'm looking looking for a replacement.,0
"Now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for BC Canada. Absolutely no need for this. The phone and app setting where the language is set to ""English"" should override any other situation. I didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev. I'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve. Update Feb 2018: 1 star for the completely uncaring attitude re: ""French"" in the holidays that I have no way to get rid of! My 1 star won't change until you do. No change.",0
I have been using BC2 for a long time. I generally like it but the month view widget just stopped displaying my calendars unless I hit the refresh button. I use Nova launcher. Please help!,1
"The most intuitive app ever! Over the years I've tried numerous self-management techniques and apps, but this is the best by far. I love that it combines so many personal productivity functions in one, including Pomo timers, Kanban boards, habit tracker, smart reminders etc. Best by far is the minimalist, flexible calendar. The devs have done an incredible job! Update: Months later and I still love this and use it daily :)",2
I enjoyed using this app to stay focus. The sense of achievement for getting the trees planted keeps me motivated.,2
"Very nice app, it helped me feel more motivated. I can now see life more as a game and as something that's supposed to be fun.",2
"Listen, this is a great tool. Take the time to learn how to use it. It will do great things for you. If you are like me and value your time, productivity, and efficiency... Use this app. As an android user, I keep my agenda view along with all my tasks and lists as a widget to the left of my home screen. I keep my calendar view to the right. Quick, clean, efficient.",2
Decent app but does NOT seem to be able to sync with my google calendar. Without that it is pretty useless to me. I like that sub-tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task.,0
Keeps me on top of things,0
I've been using this app for a week and so far it is great! It has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that I want to break or start. Way better than I thought. I never end up liking self help apps. I also never write reviews. Give the one a chance.,2
Too many items,1
"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",2
not working in my phone,0
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery.",1
I like it. What I would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as I open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock. Food for thought üòÅ. Thanks! Edit: wow! Thanks! Developer responded to my query within hours. Changed from 4 to 5 ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ!!!!,2
Good but expensive,1
Font is too small.  You have to open it up each time you want to glance at your appointments.,1
"This app is great overall, I just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also, the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own :/",2
I have been using forest since 2017 and had collected over 3000 coins. Unfortunately my phone got stolen and I had to buy a new one. Now when I reinstalled the app it's saying that I need to start collecting again and to log in I need a premium account which I have never had. How can I get my points back? Thank you.,1
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.",0
"Still cannot share a single task with someone on TickTick. You can only share a whole list. This is ridiculous, especially since the developers have promised it since 2013... I need this feature",0
"Terrible developer said could cancel anytime, believing developer, installed, then refuses to cancel for 7 days,after first payment , trickery, do not dowbnload",0
"I use it everyday and completely love it. It is very simplistic to use and understand, even for older folks like me! If I'm putting together a list of projects I want to get done; it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot, then title and save it by Category! Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",2
"Every entry gets copied so I end up with 2 of everything, one in the color I designate and the other in the standard color. If I delete 1 I loose both. I used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it.",0
This is app is absolutely awesome! I had to spend a little time customizing all the various skills and characteristics but once it's set up it's absolutely fantastic!,2
"Great overall, somewhat limited.",1
"This app has changed my life, I'd give it 10 stars if I could. It helps me manage my day to day tasks by making a list for every day of the week and switching between lists. I like that there is a widget available on my pixel phone so that I can see my checklists on my home screen.",2
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.",0
I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks,1
More hierarchy on task options?,1
"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",1
New features update now please ...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§...!!!,1
"Need to be able to repeat tasks.  If it had that, I'd be my new calendar.",1
it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.,0
"Really amazing! It helps people achieve your tasks... Better than using a ""piece of paper"". Inclusive you can fix commitments in future days.",2
"I like the concept... But it don't work. :( I am able to go on Facebook even if the tree is growing! Even now, I have a tree growing as I type. I really like the idea... but it don't work (on my phone).",1
Very cool and helps a lot,1
Well.. it worked perfectly fine for 2 days ... now it freezes after the vibration during completion of time.. The record of work also failed to register after it force closes itself... example : Today i have studied like 4hours constantly and it only registered 60mins of work.. rest of the time it freezed right after the completion.. uninstalling such a huge app...,0
This is perfect. I'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda. Also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails.,2
"It wasn't as intuitive as other organizational apps I've used but once I got the hang of it, wow. So many options to really get organized in a detailed way. I love it",2
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.,0
It replaced Wunderlist but actually the functionality was down graded . Sharing is done with a link instead of directly with a contact,1
Awesome experience,2
still testing,1
"It is absolutely amazing,I can complete my tasks now very easily.",2
Its a great app for those who understands the precious value of time. It takes time to set your own schedule but once you start....its fabulous... Keep modifying it to get best of it...,2
"If you like checking boxes off, this is a great app. You can create lists, sublists, and even nest tasks inside of a list. It's a great organizational list app.",2
Easy to use,2
"The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?",0
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",0
I really love this app but notifications are not working at all even after i allow all the permissions. So I'm not able to use this app.,2
"$36 for premium and they won't even respond to my email for technical help. Whatever, I figured it out. Good app. No help.",1
"Good idea, and attractive interface, but events have to be in your calendar 
to sync - there isn't an option to add an event directly through the app. I 
don't wish to put work time, etc. into my calendar.",1
"I love the app so I decided to install it again to keep up with school work, it works amazing but my screen is very dark, my phone brightness is all the way up but the app isnt bright but instead very dark. This has never happened before. How do I fix this?",2
"Seriously impressed with such a simple app. It's helped me go from writing list after lists in notebooks and losing them, to having it all on my phone whilst I'm out and about. Very convenient! I've already recommended to everyone I know who is like me with staying organized. Also being pregnant and having baby brain I find it hard to remember to take medication, so having a little reminder instead of an alarm is really handy. The snooze options are a wicked bonus. Thank you ü§©",2
"The guide to take the notifications off literally just shows for vivo, oppo (I don't even know what these are), Huawei and Xiaomi phones, there's no guide for simply Android or iPhone",1
"Great app, but I can't scroll through all tasks when the app is open. Hope that you'll fix that bug",1
"The app is real comfortable for use, the only thing I can't understand is how to view the events you create from the calendar icon top left?",2
"Synchronization does not work since last update with Chrome extension. I think in year 2020 when there are services such as Firebase this should be normal, however, it is not.",0
Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.,2
"Max of 9 lists, then you pay 3 bucks a month.",0
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,0
"No need for floating button on widget i think, add button on widget needs to be smaller. Also, possible to make the widget until 2x2?",1
"Nothing is ideal, but this app helped me to write a song and make my own project. It's funny, that same time I grow a beautiful garden. Thanks)",2
"I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!",2
"when you switch the language, you get wierd bug that your app is half in English half in selected language",0
"This app is AMAZING! I've tried so many to-do list apps, but this is by far the best! It allows you to do so many things! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!",2
Ace I love it,2
Nested can be improved,0
"Has many nice features but they lack polish - 1. Has notifications like TickTick but unlike TickTick, you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it. 2. Has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity.. And many others...",1
"I'm not able to sync events I add in this calendar with my Google calendar, even though I specifically pick the Google calendar every time I add a event. Also I'm not getting any notifications prior to events, you have to manually add reminders for each event, you just can't set a setting to be reminded X minutes before any event. Turns out you need to have your phone default calendar enabled to sync your events and to get notifications from this app.",1
"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",2
Any plans of allowing sub tasks to show up in the widget?,1
Very useful.. as it reminds time discipline,2
"Really hard to read when you have overlapping calendar items, which is a shame as the concept of a circular 'clock' calendar is a good one.",1
The hourly reminders don't work properly. They show up sometimes and sometimes they don't. It's unreliable that way. Otherwise the app is quite nice.,1
I want to be able to set so that the week starts from Sunday. Highly inconvenient for I frequently set the reminder wrongly. A day behind. Please upgrade so that the week start from Sunday.,1
Gud way to keep in track of our habits,1
"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",2
"After purchase, sync is not working. Then y sholud I purchase this app. Profile name is empty, while editing it says ""something went wrong"". And so on",0
"On Wunderlist, your starred/prioritsed list would break down into the original lists they came from - now they all melt together. On the starred/prioritised list you could also reshuffle jobs by holding down - now you can't.",1
New update has ruined the app...the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones...why the heck should I keep this app now in my phone... deleting....,0
the app and wid…°et are very …°ood. Will change to 5 start when I can be able to add task using google assistant.,1
Realüéâly good,1
"So I assume this app is no longer supported by its owner? Last update was summer 2018 and I saw lots of negative reviews here and on twitter about owner not responding at all. Wanted to buy premium, but first checked reviews... Ugh, it looked like a really perfect app! Sad.",1
Have used app for about 4 months now I can't get back into it. Keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either. Time to dump it!,0
I really like the app. it's pretty cool! How do I get the 24 HR clock on my Android wear? 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch! üôÇ,2
"A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times. Actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons . And the widgets, while displaying correctly, have bad interactivity. Thats said, the art is cute, the features are helpful and extensive, and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing",2
Suggestion: Can tasks take things from the inventory? Maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task.,1
"There are some things i feel need to be ironed out e.g. i found feeding the pets/mounts a bit buggy, but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them",2
"It's a good app but it always need to be online to use the app. Most of the 
items are in-app purchase.",1
"Overall decent functionality but clunky execution. The premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone, which defeats the purpose for me. The sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult.",1
"Great , but why I'm able to open and prolong operate any app immediately after assigning timer . Then after using 3 to 4 apps, "" forest "" gets to know that I'm using other apps and reminds me about my distraction....... So late!! Please fix this problem otherwise it's a great application for Controling phone distraction.",1
"Might be good, but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it.",1
I hope that they could have an alarm after the rest session ends,1
"Horrible now. Was good to start, but now that my subscription expires December 1, cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from Task names. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",0
Nice to be able to turn certain calendars on or off.,2
"I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.",0
It works great,2
It has made me more productive than ever,2
"Still evaluating the app, lots of things I thought are not available on free app, must upgrade to premium to use. App good to use so far. That why rating low.",1
"Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).",2
"This app has really helped me focus on my school work. As times are now with the e learning situation, it's done wonders for me!",2
Very usable. Occasional technical freak outs. Some shortComings in navigability and manageability,1
"Love it! A scheduling app that doesn't force me to sync my google calendar with it! I downloaded 5 different apps that all did and it was so incredibly frustrating, I deleted them all right away and finally found what I was looking for! I use my google calendar to keep track of bills and things like that, and those calendars have national holidays and other stuff I just don't want mixed in with my day to day sched. I wanted a blank calendar app to schedule things. It was surprsingly hard to find",2
"Good app it helps me be motivated without hesitation nor procastination. Thank you HabitNow!!!! Your love, Aliff",2
"‚óè 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars‚Äîbig thanks to the devs! ‚óè 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ‚óè INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune. I wish I could fix this, it's such a great app!",2
Like,2
"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",2
"I LOVED this app because it has a calendar and to-do list in one go. I can categorize my tasks and put subtasks below. But when I recently updated the app, no radio button to tick off for the subtasks. I handle a lot of tasks categorized. Plus the notes below the subtasks is not there anymore. You need to add more clicks. It was easy and organized. Now, in uninstalling. So sad, i thought I have found the app. Was about to go Premium to get the full benefits but uninstalling. üò¢",2
"Cool concept, but sync doesn't work, and the desktop add-on is half baked. I wish the developer would be responsive to my emails as well.",0
"EDIT: Nope, changing it to 5 stars anyway, it's great right now and will be brilliant when the web integration is implemented. Thank you Stephen, incredible work! Absolutely love this app and found it far more suited to my needs than any of the bigger To Do apps. Looking forward to signing up for the paid version and giving 5 stars when the web integration is rolled out, then it will be absolutely perfect.",2
App didn't work at all. Was buggy from the start of my sign up where I used my Google account to login.,0
"Great app, very useful for both personal and work reminders.",2
it‚Äôs a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ‚Äùmultiple times a day‚Äù So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?,1
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars",0
New update has ruined the app...the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones...why the heck should I keep this app now in my phone... deleting....,0
"Interrupting buzzing. The app makes a buzzing noise while I use it. First one long silence, interrupted by a buzz, short silence, then buzz before a long silence",1
"App is extremely useful just that the ""search"" feature doesn't cover all the notes in the app",1
Upgraded and lost all my tasks from previous version ... very disappointed!!!,0
For me. Good app.,1
"Interesting, just not for me.",0
"I found this app to be pretty useful. Whenever I need to get something done, I go onto this app, and plant a tree or bush. I recommended this to a few of my friends, and they're enjoying it too!",2
"Not as useful as Wunderlist... Yet!! Would prefer to have a tab for the ""week"". Not just day, that way I can anticipate. Also wish items would show up in my calendar.",1
"I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.",2
"It's useful, but the recurring task feature is a pain in the free version.",1
good,1
Really Good,2
Good app,2
"Run time exception, can't use the app.",1
Good enough for a to-do list app. A few additional features would make it even better though: option to re-arrange list; rename/edit an existing item; add a note or comment on an item; sync interval to save battery life,1
I wanted to ask if we receive any coins if we plant trees for a long period of time. Because when I planted a tree for 2 hours I didn't receive any coins. Is this intentional or a bug?,1
Pretty good and getting better with feedback. My favourite part is the integrated calendar rather than relying on third party calendar.,2
Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,2
"I purchased the paid version and I'm sort of disappointed. Every time I enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so I have to change it each time (i.e. it will autocorrect to EEvery instead of Every). It is also kind of laggy. It could be a great app, but not as is.",1
The app does not work after last nights update,0
"This is the very best app I've EVER used. If you are a lists person, ANY.DO is a must have, so easy to use, tons of feature, but as simple as you need it to be.",2
App does not work.,0
just didnt use it..,1
Nice app but requires payment for basic features.,1
"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",2
"Game is great, can give back results where you put in effort. However when I last tried to put in a task everything was empty and I cant seem to log back in.",1
"Used to love this app, but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful.",0
Nope. Nope. Nope.,0
I like but there are some basic features that aren't free.,2
Online sync is no longer working and last update was June 2018 which is more than a year. Is there a reason why I should continue using this app?,0
Very effective and easy to use habit tracker,2
"This app used to be helpful, now it doesn't give me notifications unless I open the app. When I do open the app, I am slammed with overlapping ""reminders"". I have tried everything in the settings, but nothing has helped. I like all the other aspects of this app, so it's a shame that the one thing I need it for doesn't work any more.",1
The should be some kind of dashboard where as administrator monitor progress on particular tasks and also have tasks maned by two or more personal,1
I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you,2
"Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it.",2
What about Reminders?,1
I downloaded S.Graph but I do not have any widgets with it. I have google calendar. I can open the app but there is no Home screen widget. Any way I can fix that? I have a Samsung S6 Active. Thanks a lot!,1
"Showed promise, but let down by an incredibly stupid copy function.",1
"Has many nice features but they lack polish - 1. Has notifications like TickTick but unlike TickTick, you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it. 2. Has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity.. And many others...",1
"Eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar. Porem de um tempo para c√°, mesmo com a configura√ßao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist, o evento do google calendar some. Podem verificar? Era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar. Minha versao nao √© premium e estava pensando em comprar. Estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim. Obrigada!",1
No Google tasks integration.,0
Love this app! It has really helped improve my productivity!,2
"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)",2
Achievements are not loading anymore,1
"thanks to you, this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days, and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical. But sync between calendar and app is a little time-consuming.",2
Cant share this list with others,0
Easy to use and very helpful. I love it!,2
Cant wait to try it,1
In this app it is very hard to use,0
"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.",0
I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version,0
"This is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken. The score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database. This means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day, when if you did the thing, you got 100%. As such, the visualizations are useless. A better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals.",1
"I click undo but retain the XP. No real theme or this app, very bland. Needs character",0
Crashes on android 4.4 (miui 9),0
Very useful app for keeping track of the day!,2
The current release doesn't sync appoinments i make in the app to my Google calendar. It only copies the online calendar events to the app.,1
"Just overall a great app if you want to become more concious about your daily habits. And, of course it's very helpful to create new habits / erase unwanted ones ;-) The paid version is gonna be a necessary upgrade if you want to keep track of lots of things, but it's totally worth it!",2
don't have option for Windows surface pro,1
"I have long been an advocate of the Stephen Covey 7 Habits Weekly Planner 
approach. This is the first app I've found that gives me the capability I 
need to do that well. I use the ""projects"" section to set up my ""roles and 
goals,"" and then transfer them to my weekly calendar. My only wish is that 
the tablet and phone app worked with their desktop app; it does not, as far 
as I can tell.",2
Its Great For People Who get distracted easily.,2
The app keeps crashing whenever i don't use the app for a few days. I have to uninstall and then install again for it to work normally.,2
"I have had this for years and even have the pro version. Today the application is staying I do not have pro, when I go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features.",0
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,2
"Updated: It's widget can switch between calander / todolist and view the events for the calander, in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps. It's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does. Upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event, daily planner, WhatsApp reminders, extra colors etc.",1
"Really helpful to track project with simple interface and easy to use. Anyway, it's not a variety of the feature but quite simple.",2
I loved this app until I paid for the premium version. Now it won't let me purchase any new trees and I don't have the option to earn double points. This was so much better when it was free. Please fix the issues!,0
I like the ideas of the app. However the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines. There doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well. It is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day. I would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates.,1
Snooze doesn't work most of the times. I end up forgetting/missing task notification. Also I get notification on opening app. Instead of set time.,0
After update time picker control is bad. It's very difficult to pick a time and it takes much more time to pick it. Please revert it as it was before. + one üåü for reverted time picker,2
"This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential.",0
Try on.,1
"Very organized, simple, just what I was looking for in order to keep my daily tasks organized.",2
"Very easy to pull me in I should have stopped, but hindsight is always 20/20. My friends and people who are interested in Google Apps for integrated coordination of tasks, meetings, whatever, but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 Stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription Source Capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation. Is that I'm still sitting here with this deadweight loss.",0
This is my favorite daily schedule app! It is so simple to use and super versatile. I paid for the pro version just so I could do everything and it was well worth it!,2
"Nearly perfect in terms of design, usability. The overall concept and user 
experience matches what I need. I would rate it four stars, if sync to 
cloud/other devices was added and five stars if sharing/collaboration was 
possible.",1
It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.,1
"Hides too much behind the subscription. The day views are an example of this. You'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month, week, 3 day, etc. The app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once. The features that aren't locked behind the subscription can be found in other to do apps. I tried this app and ended up choosing a different one.",0
Awesome,1
"Why is the timer not working anymore??? Worse, after the update nothing appears but a black screen. I've been using this for a few months already and this suddenly happens . Sad that I'm even on a Pro Account and I can't make the most out of it. So disappointing. :(",0
I love the interface and the colors. It's very smooth and fun to look at,2
"I just dont do subscriptions, if it was one time pay, I would actually try it, as it is.. I simply uninstalled it. No thank you.",1
"It's pretty useless, google does a better job",1
Reminders are not showing notifications for the past 1 week to me sir .. üò¢,0
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't. Give it back!",2
not so easy. Perhaps Pro version may b good. uninstall.,0
"I purchased the pro version, there was an update and now the pro version is gone. I cannot seam to get it back and I have written thru the feedback link with no response. The pro version purchase shows in my play folder but I cannot get the pro version loaded. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still no help. Need to get the pro version loaded again, please help.",1
"It's a true mystery of life how Microsoft can take ANYTHING and make it look UGLY and NEEDLESSLY COMPLICATED. Why on Earth would they not simply leave Wunderlist as-is?? So they see nothing wrong, and decide ""Time to wreck it."" Who is going to save us when they finally shut Wunderlist down??",0
"I LOVE this app! It is flexible, intuitive, attractive, and has features I have been looking for and have been unable to find in the other task list apps i have tried.",2
"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium? There is a sync option in the app. Don't tell me I should have manually ""synced"" my stuff",0
It didnt sync with the widget. Overall it great app,1
"Would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications, but not only is that a problem, but importing from a previous version of Tasks is impossible too? Nevermind. I'll just stick to what I got.",0
quite a good app for me,2
Was great before the new 'redesign'. Now it's a PITA to reschedule things. I wish they'd stop messing with things. May have to check out a different app,1
"I miss Wunderlist. Don't like this app because I can't copy a tasks or project by copying to another section. Must write out in manually which is time consuming, plus app doesn't let you cut and paste. Too cumbersome, aloe and tedious. Wunderlist was 10x what this app is. Plus I couldn't move everything over sho lo'day tons of notes. Looking at Evernote as a replacement.",1
"Does this works on android 10? I tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging. Doesn't show my character (from character-making phase). Reinstalled it, same thing occurred. Hopefully you guys can help me here. Cheers!",0
"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",2
Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings.. Than to it crashes.. It requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon. Or people wouldn't even write a review.. They would uninstall the app and find better alternatives.,0
practical and easy to use,1
Love it,2
I love this app. It gives me purpose to keep on focusing. One suggestion: can we have full screen/ zoomed view of the forest??,2
"Not what I was looking for, I saw there was a time it would remind me I 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked",0
Great app for task reminders. Reminders notifications works well. Easy to use.,2
I got it for the widget. Man it keeps me on task!,2
"It's impossible to use this app. At first, when I choosed pink theme during onboarding, the app ignored my choice. Then I filled it with all my tasks for two days, but when I closed it and opened again, the app asked me to sign up with Google. All my tasks were gone when I did it! I`m deeply disappointed...",0
"The most complicated routine managing app ever, stay away from this one.",0
"It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless.",0
This app is just impossible to use without the whitelist functionality which got removed from the free version. Great shame.,0
Amazing app to take notes and make to do lists.,2
"The widget doesn't update with the system time, often stuck until I interact with it, greatly impacting usability. I have locked the app to not be closed in recents, and a fix to this issue will change my rating.    I did pay to customize the clock face, and it's far better than the default choices though.",0
can't even name my tasks,0
The free version is all I need. It synchs with my calendar & offers alarms and reminders. Very easy access through the notification screen--one of its best features!,2
It replaced Wunderlist but actually the functionality was down graded . Sharing is done with a link instead of directly with a contact,1
"It is an OK app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name, time and place. Can not count on it to keep you informed about set Calender Events though as they are set default in 2014. Mothers Day was on the 8th; 2nd Sunday in May this year; not Wednesday the 11th. They can thank my wife for keeping me informed. It is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be? Keep an accurate calendar handy.",1
The only best time scheduler in play store.,2
"This app is amazing but after one day when I try to open it, it will just go back to my phone home screen. When I uninstall it then install it again, it will work but I will lose my forest and after a day it won't work again. Please fix this issue, I really love this app besides that issue I'm facing.",1
I've tried many to do list apps and this one is the best so far and is helping me with getting more productive with life and school work.,2
Great but when you set a target date it doesnt remain as is and shifts to another day for that month.,1
"I hate it! I loved wunnderlist, it was just perfect. Why did you guys have to change what was great??? This new App is so unclear, things don't stand out the way they did. I imported all my info from wunderlist and it is all messed up. I will be looking for another app and give up on you asap!",0
The app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries I know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference,1
"The ideal task mamager for me! Perfect combination of ability to customize tasks, design and great for team work. Still would be better if tasks added to My lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where Today, Tomorrow etc sections are. Sometimes I need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment:) If possible, I am your fan forever !",2
"It is mostly a boost to your own motivation... If you are not motivated enough, it ain't gonna work for you... There is nothing to stop you from using phone otherwise even while the tree continues to grow... Plus growing a tree as it does, is no real game or any incentive for that matter... Completing a painting or part of quest with every focused duration would have been so much better...",1
would be great to have notes implement into the app. that way it would be a bit more multifunctional.,1
"I wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info. I realize I can cancel, but would prefer to do a quick test first. I",1
"Good concept, but whenever I open the shop it says error code 668. I tryed redownloading and it didn't work.",0
