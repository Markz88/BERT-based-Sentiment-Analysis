I can't activate notification for complete focus time,0
"Prefering this over Google Calendar. There is still an annoying bug where I cant edit/delete events added to the calendar externally (through a gym app, for example). Pressing ""edit"" then it just goes back to the calendar view instead of to editing",2
My tree dies without me leaving the app ever since the new update,0
"If only this app would allow integration with Google Calendar and Todoist. I really like the promodoro timer feature of this app and wanted to use it for my tasks in Todoist. Although this app allows subscription to local calendar, you cannot use promo timer with calendar tasks. Please allow integration with other apps.",1
"App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name",0
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!,2
"Very good app but something lacl There is options default task set today, Tommorow etc, one more problem when we ADD task in any list it automatically saved in other. Other when we add task any date it demand time necessary it shoud be Optinal",1
Awesome üëç,2
Buggy! Won't let me edit rewards. No.,0
Full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event !!!,0
Can not cancel subscription,0
"I've been looking for an app that can do what HabitBull does and I'm so glad I finally found it. It's a great, easy to use app and the messages you get are so cute.",2
"I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find.",0
"It's not as straight forward as others. But I like the many color options I have a task that is a grocery list, so it is lengthy. In moving from list to list I have accidentally removed items. I don't see an undo.",2
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.,0
"Love this, exactly what I was looking for. However would be great if there is a web app or app on Mac",2
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free.",0

It's takes a lot of space,0
Could be easier to set up and save notes. Was confusing at first but a good app,1
Boxes are too wide on the widget. It was better on wunderlust as I could see a lot more at once.,0
I cannot log into the application somehow. Please help me!!,0
"It is a very good app for staying focused while studying, but the problem I'm facing now is that the music keeps stopping at random intervals and I have to unlock the phone to keep the music playing. Please look into this otherwise it's a great app.",1
Better than previous app I used,2
Just a awesome app!! Update: This app has really helped with my adhd! Still love the app. Now if I could do email from it. It would be the best app I have ever downloaded.,2
"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier.",2
Ok,1
"Awful. I can't believe Microsoft killed off Wunderlist and is forcing people to use this slow, ugly POS or lose their data. That's Microsoft for you!",0
"I Love the concept, I've always saw the parallel between RealLife and an RRG in terms of skill growth and education.",2
No updates long time ago,1
Missing a few good features and isn't always the most stable of apps,1
Very versatile app. I used this primarily as a to-do list and grocery list.,2
The tasks may go missing...,1
Great app with just about every function I want for a task list. Love the way it integrates with the calendar. It used to work with Google voice activation but that seems to have ceased.,2
One of the most useful apps on my smartphone,2
Easy to use. A direct link with other apps(Google calendar/ outlook calendar) would be a great add ON.,2
"Why are you counting inactive habits for the 5 habits total? It's ridiculous! There are many other apps that don't have this silly, cash grabbing limit.",0
"I gave it a lower rating because lately if I had any repeat scheduled appointments, I can't change one without changing them all. Very aggravating. Before, I was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries. Before, I could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities. Now it looks like I attended a meeting when I didn't because I couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings",1
Helpful,2
"Unsupported. Doesnt contain sync feature. Wouldn't issue refund. To the makers and google, get on your hands and knees and repent to g*d",0
"This calendar is lovely to use. Minimalist, asthetically pleasing and 
exactly the functions (and view options) I was looking for. Love it!",2
Very helpful,2
So far it's everything I need & was looking for.,2
This app is great to organize your day or make shopping lists etc. But sadly I don't get notifications even if I turned them on. I hope this will be fixed soon!,2
WHY DO notes dissapear? I pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To Answer:1)Yes 2)local 3) i go in the App-Month View-click on day box-write details+hour/all day.save.Then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone .4) i have a stable internet connection . What should i do?,0
"Pretty solid app, does what it seems, but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to. Instead of going off at the time I set, they all go off next time I open the app. They never go off until I open the app, so they're useless.",0
Something that bothered with the calendar widget is that tasks that span for multiple days are separated into blocks in contrast to a continuous line.,1
it has reminders but would be great to show the due date as my reminders are often days before instead of on the due date itself and what heading it was put under so know which project's task it is.,1
"I really like this app. Even when you are retired one needs some order to keep balance in one life. I have learned to appreciate its benefits: tasks (the little things we seem to forget every day), shopping lists, reminders and the themes that makes it fun. üëçüëç",2
If you want to start a project you have to pay 4.99 a year.,0
"I've only been using this app for a week or so but I love it. It's easy to set up and use, and I appreciate that it gives me a percentage of my successful days.",2
Good app,1
Force closes when trying to create challenge,1
This app is a piece of sh**. It won't sync my old wunderlists. Shared lists don't work. I'll be uninstalling and going with a different app. Thanks Microsoft for taking a fantastic app (Wunderlist) and ruining it.,0
This is a brilliant little app! I frequently struggle with executive dysfunction and this app really helps me get things done!,2
Great way to visualize daily schedule in a more intuitive way,2
"I've spent hours on it already and I'm just not getting it. Looks like most tutorials are for an older version. Can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day Routines, what's the difference between a Routine and an Event, etc.",0
Nice but cost too much yearly to buy.,2
Best free version todo list app,2
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",0
"I used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new Samsung 10 the Google Tasks sync has stopped working. It synchronises from Google to Business Calendar but will not synchronise from Business Calendar to Google. ] I have tried disconnecting my Google account and reconnecting, I've made sure BC2 Tasks is associated with my Google account and all Sync settings are turned on. Is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please? Thanks.",1
"Notifications do not show up. Thought I have enabled all permissions and to override dnd, the notifications and reminders do not work.",1
Nice idea,1
"How different it is from Google Calendar ? Your idea is Good and interesting, I am a knd of person who try following this.",1
Never tried it yet,0
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime,2
Please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and/or month-style display,1
"The last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working. The company that owns it seems to be a scam. It was a great app, I paid for it and got no support",0
"This really helps me to stay organized with my appointments, birthdays and other important dates.",2
"Wonderful app, unique and very useful, great design and functionality.",2
No white space between tasks. No line between tasks. Checkboxes are in the middle of an item. One big block of text instead of neat list of tasks. Just impossible to see where each task starts.,1
"I love BC1 and BTasks, but am disappointed that BC2 will not bring my tasks from BT and the new integrated BT syncs only to Google tasks but no longer my Toodle-Do account. Deal breaker for me!  Why would you break the functionality with your own BTasks app???",1
"How soon until the list sharing is available? If soon, you have just earned a small business customer.",1
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.,0
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.,0
Not really interesting. Doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place.,0
Very useful app. How do I get the notifications to disappear automatically once they pop up? I don't want to stay clear them every time. Thank you.,2
"I'm trying to add a task, press ""add button"" (the arrow) and the task just disappeares. Quite simple functionality and even this with bugs",1
Awesome,2
"Update: I did all the steps.. still not working... It is getting frustrating üòì I really love this app. But off late it just keeps crashing. Can anybody help? Updated: Thanks for the reply! There was no auto update option in my phone settings. So, I have disabled auto update in google play. Will it work?",0
Excellent and terbaik...üëçüëçüëç,2
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self.",0
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling",0
Subpar so far The difficult to me is syncing lists between family members. This app tends to produce multiple lists of the same theme.,0
"Been a user of the app for 5+ years. Has been helpful in managing a busy life. Up until recently would have given 5 stars. Three stars because of poor app support. I think I have finally worked out my issue, but disappointed in level and responsiveness of support. Just hope you never need support.",1
"I love ticktick and have returned after trying a few other task apps. The problem is that it's all a it buggy. Emails sent to be added as tasks dissappear if sent automatically through Gmail, and my online Web based tasks are different to those on the app. Maybe time to look again at other apps... ü§î @ticktick who should I email? I'm also totally fed up as it no longer works with Google Assistant üò¢.",0
"My go to tasks app. Happy to finally see a premium payment because you deserve money for this thing, but immediately saddened that it's subscription only! I get why, but please add a one time payment option too for those of us who don't want to deal with such things.",2
"This is far from what Wunderlist made us use it, you no longer have details section in a task where for example you could add a link to a picture or describe more the task in hand... It seems it tried to be more of a daily scheduler than what actually the amazing Wunderlist was!",0
"I would gladly pay $5 for the premium features of this up, but they want a monthly subscription. I don't think that's a fair price at all, but it's a good app with the free features so... 3 stars.",1
Brilliant,2
"It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar‚Ä¶ not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!",0
Desktop version is better,2
It doesn't work. Worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server,0
"A beautiful app but.. I would love an option where you dont have to set a time, you just put it on and watch the trees grow as you work and come back to your phone an hour or two hours, whenever youre done! I also found that trees die if I dont come back fast enough after my timer expires? Like if I set my timer for 1 hour and I come back in 2 Ill find the tree died, thats weird, is that a bug on my end? Beautiful app guys, I love it but those things above would have me using it more!",2
doesn't sync to my smartwatch üòû,0
Can not use custom rutin name,1
It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all,1
Beautiful graph/calendar. I love how beautiful and practical this is. I love it,2
"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",1
Great app but as someone else mentioned there's no calendar view which for me makes it pointless. Real Shame. The search goes on...,1
"good shared tasks, but app itself makes me angry.. it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account.. so I need to login for like each two weeks or so.. and it also forgets my settings... Edit: unfortunately this has not been fixed yet, even though I had sent logs and communicated with you. Decreasing my rating.",0
Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.,2
Very good app! Helps me stay organized.,2
It really helps you get focused on your priorities and do your job,2
nice app the only challenge have seen is that sometimes the notifcation alarm does not work,1
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient",0
May I know what's the difference between this app and the any.do calendar app?,2
Does everything you need when you have a task top of mind throw it in Anydo.,2
TimeTune is a great app too keep up with dailu routines. It has many useful options and it's overall great.,2
"Misleading, all themes require pro.",0
Keeps crashing before I can even sign in.,0
"Too complicated, trying to add items to a list, it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this.",0
Why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point.. You guys are just a company trying to get rich.,0
it does not remind us so I deleted this app,1
"The app is fine but the widget never became available on my phone or watch. 
The widget was the whole reason I used this app.",0
cant move the tasks up or down,0
"Very awesome so far! I really love how customizable this is. It does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features, but I am super happy üëç. Hope it continues to be great with continued use.",2
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.,0
Not as good as Wunderlist. Simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as: 1. sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to My Day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened - makes adding lots of pages in a row slow. 2. Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list. Other than that it looks smart and imported my old Wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt.,1
"I really love the app! But I have one suggestion though, I hope you make the trees animated so users can have a better experience and enjoy their forest more! Nevertheless, this app is üí£",2
Nog that bad,1
I can't get a refund and the app doesn't work. Google play is zero help and I can't reach a developer! I've been robbed.,0
"great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality, look to Any.Do rather than this app. In dialogues with the devs, theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple WearOS apps (like add task from watch). Uninstalled",0
Would be better if it could hide declined events,1
Swipe to delete is terrible. Takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless.,0
"It seems OK, but very basic. Recurring tasks need some work to be actually useful. For example, it would be nice to be able to set a task to be recurring on the first of every month, without only being able to set that up on the first of the month. Edit; I also just noticed that there is no dark theme. Both may be available as paid for options, but I'll never know, since they are basic options and without them, I have no reason to try this app, and thus will never pay for actual premium options.",0
"Last update.is bad, its hard to put time for the task i dont why you have updated that.... i paid for something easy to do why you are making it hard to put a time for the task",1
"Cool app! Can almost replace the other widgets I have on my home screen, but missing one feature (which is not the fault of the app, but a shortcoming for my particular needs): weather. Include weather and I can easily pay for this app! Still keeping as it is a good app!",2
"a) Add shortcut to home screen is broken on my Pixel 3. b) Please add ""delete all completed task"" to overflow menu (besides the hide feature) c) widgets are seriously broken; their color/theme is incorrect (white but should be dark) and widget is empty even though list it shows is not",1
"Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up.",0
There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.,1
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery.",1
This app would not let me start a new day. It listed my tasks that I performed for one day as overdue for the next day. Just weird.,0
Doesn't work. Error messages appear everywhere when I open the app.,0
no comments,1
I like it,2
This app would be better if it support jalali(Shamsi) date format :-),1
Love it,2
Two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year. Is this application still supported by the dev team?,0
"Im using the free app & enjoying it alot! Super easy to capture ideas and reminders when they pop into your head, before you forget!",2
"Generally I liked this app but I found it very frustrating that I couldn't view all my tasks in one area, ie. Inbox. Or by by date. I had to go through each list individually.",1
You reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying,0
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,0
"It was good but I guess Google is sabotaging it, so I lost a couple of notifications. Removed it and started using Google calendar and notifications are now ok. Sorry.  I have uninstalled the program since I missed an important appointment I can no longer trust it.  Probably the solution you provide works, but I think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments.",0
Ok,0
Very helpful and detailed app...love it!,2
No auto/custom tags?!!! Really??,1
"This app was AMAZING when I first started using it. Now it duplicates tasks 
too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks.",0
"I like it but sometimes does not response correctly, and need more options to do the daily use easier",2
Leave it to Microsoft to screw up Wunderlist. I used it for my show notes while I was out and about. I could input my note and it would go to the top of the page. Now it goes through the bottom and I have to drag every single note to the top. It's annoying.,1
"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore",0
The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,0
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.",0
"This app is supposed to replace Wunderlist. This app requires you to have an outlook account. Ok, fine. It is not easy to invite others, not user friendly, always logs out, and requires you ok sign into account.live. Will NOT recommend at this time.",0
"This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.",0
Brilliant and incredible app. It turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple RPG concept. Love it!!!,2
"It's very optimised for everyday notifications, notes, list making and planning in general. The widget is quite handy, offering a preview of all the day of the week and tasks and events you have written down! My recommendation.",2
"I'm coming from Wunderlist and I feel quite comfortable with the feel of the app, except that I miss the main view of one selected list's tems. It'll be cool if you added an alternative to the home view",2
The more I use this app the more I love it. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. One thing: I'd like to be able to sort my routines chronologically rather than alphabetically.,2
"Looks a lot like todoist. I said ""look"" because todoist is bug free when compared to this one. What a waste of time I had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking...",1
"I love this app, it keeps me organized and is simple to use. It has a lot of features in the free version but isnt too complicated. Some apps try to do too much, not this one, it does what I need and it does it well. I love the feature to make lists or schedule tasks, set a tasks priority, or quickly move it to tomorrow when I've over scheduled myself. Highly recommend.",2
I like it it's very reorganizing,1
"Definitely not worth downloading. The app keeps crashing. Does not record the time focused properly and hinders with functioning of the other apps. No point in buying the premium version either, a total waste of money. Latest update is just not upto the mark. Customizing anything usually results in the app crashing.",0
"In my last phone, Asus Zenfone C, I can use this app well, but after I changed my phone to Samsung J7 (2016), it automatically connects with either Samsung or Google calendar, where I can't edit the event colors freely on the clock. I'm very disappointed, so I had to uninstall. Sorry.",0
"Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the ""18 hour"". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app",0
"Helped me stay focused! Usually when I study I always have my phone around and i keep getting distracted by my phone(twitter, yt etc.) i have an upcoming exam this week and I decided to stay focus so I downloaded this app! Its great and it really works! The first time i tried to give up i was so sad to kill a tree so i try to focus! I really recommend this app especially for my fellow students! (also excuse my grammar because english is not my first language :)) )",2
"After I grow a plant, when it gives the option of double reward by watching a video, I click on double reward. And it shows a video which I watch also, after that the screen goes black, nothing happens, and I had to close it, when I try to open again ,it says forest app is not responding.And when I click OK for that, and open the app, it opens, but with only half reward, there is no double reward given , even after I watch the advertisement video, what kind of cheating is this? Please fix it.",1
"I like this app but I give only 3 stars because I am unable to bye new plants , whenever I go to Store to bye new plants it always load , loading never stops and , so I was always unsuccessful to bye new plants. Please make any solution for this problem so then I can give you 5 stars",1
"it was working great, for about 2 weeks but now shuts down ant time I try and invite atty attendee to any event. so disappointed. I thoight this was going to be my ""go to"" app and be reliable. the search continues....",1
"Love the content, but the price is way too high for premium",1
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.,0
"Love the app, but I notice it skips a reminder from time to time.",2
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.,0
"Colourful, friendly and let me manage my homework",2
Best timetable app but i want you suggest that upcoming timeline we can see in notification bar it makes app more better for all,2
Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?,1
"Just Downloaded so far great, but I'm looking for an application I can use between two or more, i.e. minors etc. Where I can send a task via messenger for example. does this app upload if the other user also has Task?",1
"not very user friendly, atleast for me. the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates. i have to put every thing manually, like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm. and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me",0
Worth paying for premium,2
"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance.",1

"I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me. If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky. I think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks, habits and dailies.",1

Great app! Helped me get my time optimized and scheduled. Thank you very much developers!(1 suggestion would be to add auto backup on the cloud through google and so on),2
"Great App. Like the options of multiple routines, calender, and reminders. However I wish there was more control over the routines. I'd like to be able to pick the start of my day instead of it starting at 12am. I'd also like to be able to pick what week days for a routine to be active so I can have different routines each day. You can manually program it if you pay for pro version but it's a hassle to go day by day if the routine is going to be used for months.",2

I am examining the possibility of transferring from the excellent Wunderlist app to this Microsoft To Do. It has been a Challenge so far. Question: How do I connect Microsoft To Do with Google and Samsung Calendars just as we did with Wunderlist? Thanks,1
The app works great as a digital day planner. The only complaint that I have. I dont see a way to edit tasks after I enter them.,2

Im an entrepreneur with many projecrs and it def keeps me on track. Cons: I wish it could track the amount of time I spend on each major task & sub task, like a time clock. Is this a possibility in Q1 or Q2 of 2020?",2
I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.,0
Why it is not giving me notifications for dailies?,1
Wanted vertical and horizontal in routines like before and not to display that alarm clock. Thank you for your feedback i love it.,2
This app refuses to let you set a reminder for any day other than the current day without buying premium. i want to remind myself to workout every Wednesday but it's monday so I'm only allowed to schedule reminders on Monday. Guess I'll just get reminded on monday to workout on Wednesday. Useless,1

"So as HUGE fan of Wunderlist I was devastated to hear that it was going to cease. Along comes To Do. So most of it works similar to Wunderlist which is good, but there's little things I just don't like. For example, when tapping on a list. Boxes are too BIG and in your face, text too big also. Main screen is ok. When ticking something off on a list how about something to divide to do and done from that list instead of everything together. Give us more customisation options for sizes, colours etc",1

"Dear support! It is a pity that Microsoft is closing Wunderlist, because that app is very simple to use and very fast. Unfortunately your to do app is slower, there is not done job with hashtags.

At least upgrade your app normally. Thank you.",1
Great app! Been wanting a routine type ap for awhile definitely nice to have for my schedual!,2
"When trying to add from the widget, it does not add to the selected list, instead it adds to tasks. Very annoying. This makes the widget borderline useless.",1

"I like this app and use it on my Android phone and iOS iPad. It's easy to use, don't need to buy anything, and is clear. I don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how I expected, but it's a good app.",2
"Not as good as wunderlist. Supposed to verify before deleting but it doesn't. Lost entire list by accidentally touching and yes, I have it turned on in settings. At least with wunderlist you could see deleted items and undo. Going to find something better than this then uninstalling.",0
"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?",1

Overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time. Always showing delayed time until manual update.,2
"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into.",0

PLEASE make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select. this would be VERY convenient. thank you.,0
Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.,0
Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,1
"So far a little lonely, but really fun! It really is like playing a game! I almost have enough to buy a real sword!",2

"I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.",0
"I like it a lot, but I think it needs a way to tell what day you're in. It 
does ask if you did things yesterday, but I sometimes get reminders for 
things on the wrong days... It's still a very good resource.",1
I really find this very useful and easy to use. Very user friendly. Only problem is there is no way to delete all completed tasks...it has to be done one by one. Any chance of fixing that?,2
it's just a simple to do list ... why did you locked some tools ..,0
"This app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the ""Lock Forest to Stay in Foreground"" feature. As of right now it's basically useless, but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature! So other than that it would be 5-stars. Don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones",1
"It was working ok for a couple of months, then would not let me sign in.    Funny thing is I don't remember signing out!  I would simply hit the icon on my android and it would just be there.  Sure looks like it works for others.",0
"Love it so far! I would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day. for example, they are listed in the order you enter them. But I want my am on the top of each page and my p.m. appointments in the afternoon on the month view. it would be great if you can just drag and drop. I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing.",2

"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them.",1
Such a great app. I use it dozens of times each day!,2
"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",0
Best to do list app. I've tried so many to do list app bit this is certainly the best!,2
The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.,0

"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",1

I'd like to be able to check an app for Mon., Tue, Weds., etc but without having to set a specific reminder for each. Monday should just be Monday without needing to set a time. Would be great to just have a list for the whole day.  2) For lists such as grocery lists, I don't see any setting to allow the app to stay on screen if you are currently in a store and trying to buy off your list. This is important!! No one wants to grocery shop and have to constantly unlock their screen to see the list.",1
It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not,2
"Great incentive/nudge to be present during the activity/practice of your choice. A gentle way to reinforce mindful habits. If I know my tree is going to die because of lack of time or focus, I either clear more time if possible, schedule the task for a more appropriate time-slot or take a few deep breaths to center to why I chose to do this or is this something I really want to do in the first place. It's like a little promise to yourself before diving in.",2

"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",0
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years.

"Very nice looking, the pricing is just right, and I love that you can have subtasks upon subtasks. But... almost nothing about it is intuitive. For an app that is all about helping the user be more productive, to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks... well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn. UX test your app please.",1
I keep getting a popup that habbitbull has stopped working. idk why it was even open in the first place but it is constantly annoying me. and i don't even see any of actual issues that the crash is causing besides the annoying popup. I've sent feedback a few times but no response,1
How to restore my pro version?,0
waste of time...dont download,1

"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap",0
this is helpful for accountability,2
It is a great app and it helps me keep my schoolwork on time,2
Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.,0
This app is a gold standard for life and work management.,2
I've been using BC1 for years and I've installed BC2 on at least 2 seperate occasions. BC2 is so not as good as BC1. The overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game. The functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to BC1 such a pleasure. I can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes. After using BC1 for so long I had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be. These days I'm looking elsewhere.,1
useless! you need a premium account to use Widgets,0

A great way to get organized and remember your to-do list!,2
"Loving it! But are there themes on the horizon? Not a huge fan on purple! And where can see a weekly/monthly summary of how I'm keeping up with my dailies? Also I noticed a bug when I accidentally hit 'create' multiple times for a new daily, it will create multiple instances of it.",1
I really like it. But there's one or two thing's that need to be addit. I Personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is Option for never delete Plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name,1
Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,2
I like it. Paying month after month for premium features isn't for me though.,1
It's just as good as Wunderlist and so much more,2
"Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix. For everyone else,my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until I can remove the complete buttons, shrink text, have fully customizable widgets, or settle on another app. but really, focus on the root problem.",0
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps.",0
It's a great app don't get me wrong but it's a kind of over complicate things with certain widgets and etc.,1
Habit widgets stopped working. After a day they just go blank and don't ever come back. The widgets where my favorite part of this app so that's too bad :(,1
"Still needs some work to get it up to par with Wunderlist, but works ok",2
One of the best apps to boost your productivity. Replete with useful features even in the free version. Love their habit feature.,2
awesome application,2
Friendly app that help you to optimize your time.,2
"This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.",0
"I had hope for this Calendar app but apparently in order to see the calendar in a normal format as to the list format, you have to pay a premium, & that is not what I want to do. I'm very disappointed uninstalling & will be looking for another calendar app. All in all it seams like a good calender app but just not for me.",0
"Very easy to use and intuitive. Wish there were a way to roll incomplete tasks forward to a new list or a different list (I tend to make a list for each day). Otherwise, love it.",2
Failed to connect to Facebook,0
"This app requires a ridiculous amount of permissions, including location, camera, and data cookies?? When I heard about this app, I got excited. Really thought it was going to be nothing more than say an animated timer that only works when you stay within the app (like Youtube pauses when you switch apps). This is just downright data mining and invasive. Edit: Funny that I mentioned this and now it doesn't say the same thing.",0

Great app. Gives me the motivation to do the work and have a little garden of my own. But lately it doesnt want to start. Crashes as soon as i click on it. Please do something.,1
"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data",0
Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,2
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...,0
"It was a great app until they ruined the widgets. I pay for premium membership which is supposed to include priority support, and yet their customer service is ignoring my requests for help. UPDATE: yes, customer support responded, but they didn't solve any of my issues! These devs are great at not listening to their customers. I've switched to a different task app and I'm much happier (Tasks by Stephen Nottage, check it out!)",0
Worst apk reminder not work,0
This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!,0
It'hs just too complicate to use for me,0
"Have been using this now for over a year, after trying a few. It is absolutely the best. All depends what you need it to do but it has great options and flexibility. Works just fine, I do have a slow to load glitch on the widget on the phone. Other than that it's great",2
Ads ads ads.,0
"Deleted my account because I found something more aligned to my needs, but I still got charged for another year. Developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via PayPal so I've now paid $28 for something I can't and no longer want to use.

fun and easy,1
"Like the app, but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times",2
Best app for planning and scheduling...jst bless u developers,2

3 of 5 stars. That's all.,1
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.,2
"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",2
"I'm using this app for work for Due Diligence. When I first installed the app I was sure I could ""search"" my notes for key words now I can't. Am I doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app?",1
Very useful! Syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks,2
Great app. Does exactly what I needed and wanted. Simple to use.,2
The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,2
"As a taxi driver I do runs for two friends at all times of the day and 
night. I've downloaded loads of these things trying to find one that I can 
simply put in a job with a simple title like 'Bristol Airport Pickup', with 
the time I want to be reminded (not the time I make the first pickup) and 
one that I can add notes to for phone numbers, first pickup address and 
fare. Most importantly it must sound the notification even if mute is on at 
night and early mornings when ai am asleep. Every one I tried did the first 
two, none did the latter two. This one. It does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a 
big oversight - so it is of no use to me apart from runs when I am awake. 
Please fix tbis and I will hapily buy it. Please also add a feature so I 
can choose what reminder sound I want instead of it using the default 
notification sound.",1
Why would I pay money to have recurring events in a planner. I think I'll stick with my default calander app,1
easy to use and calendar is useful. i think its just a cash grab to pay for full month calendar view. but other than that its great,1
This one is very beautiful but its tree texture is not beautiful.,1
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.,0
"It's effective. Yes it's better than a lot of other options out there. It's just dated, the interface is weak and difficult to navigate. They could really make some strong improvements by streamlining it. I bet most users, pro or not, aren't aware of all the settings.

Need a cleaner GUI,1
I don't know how I feel,0
Not as good as its old version wunderlist. Especially when you want to upload and download files through this app.,2
I'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app. All the things that I'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription. As a rule I do not subscribe to anything unless I am confident it will add value. A trial would help me make that assessment.,1
"App was great, but now I cant set my work end times, only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update. Bad timing guys. Uninstalling app.",1
Quite adequate for reminders ; Simple and easy to use.,2
"The app is great, wish the premium version was cheaper though. 3.49 per month is just too much.",1
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.",0
"It's just okay. I much preferred Wunderlist. I'd give a 5 star rating if Microsoft To-Do added new items to the top of the list, not the bottom, and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the ""star"" on that item, similar to Wunderlist. Needless to say, I'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than I had used Wunderlist, until this is fixed. It's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists, which tend to be VERY long.",1

This game is a great way to get things done. I love the idea of not being able o leave the app or your tree will die. I consider this a great tool as I am homeschooled.,2
It's Google calendar with different color scheme,0
"I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",2
A great way for a visual person to outline and track their activities,2
"Nice app! I just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie... 35, 30, 7:35, 30, 8:35, 30, 8:35. it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious. How can I remove these? UPDATE TO REPLY: Thank you, but I am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use. Can this function be disabled?",1
"Thank you developers for creating such a marvelous app, i found app history on the link you provided below, and it has all records of everything. This app has really changed my life, I hope to see more such apps from the developers. And there are no cons or bugs i have faced till now. May god bless the developers for improving the lives of people, I would rate 7 stars for such a extraordinary app. Lots of love <3",2
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",1
"The app struggles to sort by due date, I think it is at least in part due to the imported tasks (from Wunderlist).",0
"Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.",0
"Good BUT... STILL does not handle repeat events such as Daylight Savings Time change (i.e. setting a reminder for the second Sunday of March each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically). Does not handle ""last day of the month"" reminders well. Also, the list should display an icon by repeating tasks. Backup options are very limited, does not handle integration with e.g. Dropbox. Otherwise it would be perfect for my needs.",1
Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?,1
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.,0
I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,1
"Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug",0
"There's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view, even in high end phones. Going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks (shows popup) whether you wish to save or discard changes, that popup is irritating. Otherwise an effective and the point app. Cheers!",1
Useful widget to view the schedule of calendar. What I like the most is I can just activate one event of Google Calendar and see it in the widget. Was looking for this type of app for a long time üëç,2
"wunderlist was awesome, this replacement works slow with terrible UI and missing features from original app",0
Enables you to sandwich your productivity in double slices of focus. It's definitely my go-to planner.,2
Looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone. I can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white. Went with LifeRPG instead.,1
"I do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin, needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position",2
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.,0
"Haven't used it a lot yet, but enjoying the simple way to add tasks",1
I really like the idea of this app but it doesn't function well for me. I'm a musician and I tried using it for practise but I had to use an metronome in the phone and then the tree always dies. I wish it was possible to let it grow without having to look at it all the time . Maybe also a pomodoro function?,1

Non sense,0
"I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.",0
"Real hassle to set up with synchronization with others. I cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it, with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared. I much preferred wunderlist which worked fine. Why won't Microsoft leave well alone? I do not need this app to run my life, just keep lists which can be mine or shared.",0
Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.,0
"I liked the app and it looked like it had a good set of features, but I didn't like the $4.99/year recurring subscription fee.",1
"Great concept, but not quick to use. Creating events through Google Calendar takes time, I would like to be able to use without syncing to any calendar. Perhaps add an option to store events locally instead of syncing to outside calendars. And make that process quick and ease Edit: Thank you, I have found that option!",2
I really love this app and recommend it to anyone but since i went premium nothing works. I can't go to the shop section or see my achievements. I hope they'll fix those issues with an update soon. Only 1 star because of the issues otherwise would have been 5 stars.,0
"I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying.",0

"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly.",1
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days.

Absolutely love the app but the new checkboxes take up too much space. Please add an option to hide them.,1
Not Free. Free upto only 5 Habbits.,1
"It's a very good planner app. I had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps, but none of their free versions were worth my time. This free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads. However, if you're a student as I am, the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the $2.99 a month",2
Very usable. Occasional technical freak outs. Some shortComings in navigability and manageability,1
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.,0
"I have a big problem with this app, daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it. But somtimes i really could not complete it. then ist stop, why?!!!!",1

"Things to do: - Add a ""Move task"" icon to the single selection toolbar (it's currently in the ""..."" menu, annoying) - Use the de facto Android standard for multiple selection: the LONG PRESS, gosh! Other than that, 3 stars for the occasional bugs. Tasks are often slow to move, as in I move a task then after 2s it goes back then moves again, making it a mess. Tasks got sometimes lost in other subtasks because the drag and drop gesture is clumsy.",1
"This is my first time giving a review on any App I've downloaded. This App is a huge downgrade from the now defunct Wunderlist. The fact that you need to use a Microsoft account is annoying but to add insult to injury you can't even share the lists normally with people ""Outside your organisation"" (what ever that means) so now all I have is a glorified sticky note... I mean had, I'm erasing this app the second I finish this review.",0
"Download it because I love that it has a weekly, monthly and daily goal views, also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like I can't cross off events, only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen",1
"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.",0
Wow they listened. They added links between task which was my idea. Good. If only they could be consistent across platforms. Improve rating to 4 stars just cuz the ticktick team is really trying to be better Aldous allow us to see the changes you make in the app.,2
"If I wish to make an app , this would be the best idea I can came with",2
It doesn't work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks.  I have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly.,1

Moreover, don't know if this is my problem, I can't see reminders. I see them inside the calendar app but not here. Hope they will improve so I can finally give a sweet 5 stars, the idea itself is brilliant!",1
"I went through all the stuff to link this to my Google Assistant, but it doesn't work right. I can get it to add a task, supposedly, but when I tell it to read my tasks it says I have no tasks for today and doesn't give me any way to list the complete set of tasks, the ones I just added. This is worthless.",0
I haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the Calender that came on my last phone.  I wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day.  Otherwise it is easy to use and functional.,1
"Uncomfortable manual typing for time setting in a reminder. Time reminders are not stable, some times push notifications doesn't work.",1
I just downloaded& installed this app. I was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp. Preferably using a button on the screen.

"I really do like this, but there's one (probably petty) reason I have given 
it a three. My class. I cannot seem to change from warrior to something

health and the such. I would be much more motivated to help my healer.",1

"I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead.",1
it makes you rate the app and its extremely annoying.,1
"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority.

"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.",1

alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser,0
"Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker.",1
I love this app,2
"Uhm there's a little bug that I encountered, I cannot disable the skill 
decay :< pls fix I'll give 5 stars",1
"The app is great for the most part, i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me. No alarm or even a pop-up message. I got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues, but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app. Please fix the alarm notification system.",1
This is bad ass. I really love the originality of the concept.,2
I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.,1

Good. Works offline so I love that. But one improvement they must include is to allow us to have a hierarchy in projects. Else it is too cluttered,2
"It was working fine until recently, I bought new bush but when I have successfully planted (it told me it was successful) I saw it planted the last tree I had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead (even tho it said I planted 7 successful trees).

The to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency. It would be great if you could add that.,1
"After update, I couldn't log in to my Google account, the button Allow wasn't working.

After pressing 'ok' several times, it went away. However, now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud. I wanted to buy Pro, not anymore. You can't fix the bug with Google account for several months now. Embarrassing.",0

Better tips: it will great we can customize without google calender,1
"Integrative calendar! I've been using this for a few years now. It combines multiple accounts, syncs fast, and the widgets are really flexible. One suggestion to the Devs is putting in an automatic ""Do Not Disturb"" option so you can be certain your phone won't ring during an event.",2
"I really loved the app but after using it once, it does not launch and keeps crashing. I have tried reinstalling but it only works the first time I open it , then later I can't open it(keeps crashing). I use a Samsung M30 , if that helps.",1
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.,2

Great app,2
Is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things I've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day?,0
"I like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done, everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks,i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit,therefore i won't plant trees, i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't.It's rly a problem. please fix this! Tnx",2
my app keeps kicking me off after i open it,0
"I've had this app for a while and I love it. But after the last update it hasn't notified me that my time is up. The tree is planted but my phone doesn't go off. All the notifications it could have are turned on, so I don't know why this is. Help, please?",2
"The new interface is cluttered and hard to use. Edited, in response to the query below.  In the older interface, a routine had a separate page for each day of the week. Now it's a continuous scroll. The older approach seems cleaner.",0
I've always had issues with consistency and will power. It's very helpful when can see my progress. It even tracks the percentage of your success.,2
I paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review,1
"I was not planning to give a review but it left me no choice since its replacing wunderlist which is very useful app which my wife and I love especially for our grocery lists, now this TO DO tries to replace it but can't even get it to work properly!!! IF I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR, I WOULD!!!",0
Very nice app. It could use some more work. But I like the color tags and the plan your day feature.,2
Awesome,2

"Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled.",0
"After adding task to the app, it just doesn't shows up.",0
very helpful,2
"it shows you all the features, very helpful and everything and as a final blow... it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase. This is very very misleading for someone who have given their time, signed in with google, synced their events etc. frustrated.",0
"This app is a very very poor replacement for Wunderlist, which is a wonderfully organized app. Wonderlist should never be taken out of the app market! In my opinion, it's the Microsoft app that should disappear on May 6, NOT Wunderlist! Wunderlist has a 4.6 approval rating; Microsoft has a 4.2 rating. That should tell you something. It took an act of God for my Microsoft account to get up and running. It was locked and I was forced to jump through several hoops. Ridiculous!",0

Wile installing on my Note 9 it imported / shows promptly each allready existing entry from each of my Calendars. But It does not import / synchronize any new entry ( via any calendar ). (  Within Android I already removed the app from being affected by the Battery saving-option ) ( 'Close the Demo' pop-up is not present ) Thank You very much for helping out because this way of visualization by merging Agenda and Clock-face is how my mind needs it (used it many years ago and never found it back again as a contemporary app. If only I get it to work..,1
"Overall it is a nice clean design, but reminders seem useless as I'm not given an option to change the time. It's currently 1:45 and no matter what it sets the reminder to 2. Tapping reminder just turns it on/off. Long press and swipe do nothing. Also no due dates + ""today"" list for helping with daily agendas.",1

Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. üëå,0

really great concept but .......not much useful and not even that beautifully eye-catching thing,1
easy to use and calendar is useful. i think its just a cash grab to pay for full month calendar view. but other than that its great,1
"UPDATE: This app is great! But I'm currently not using it. I'm not using it because the widget colors don't work for me. I'd like there to be different colored backgrounds and text colors for past vs current vs future activities. I want to see at a glance what I ought to be doing at that moment, without opening the app. I'm keeping the app installed, in the hopes that the widget will be improved. Thanks, dev!",2
"Awesome app! Used it before, but downloaded again to help me focus while studying at home during social distancing.",2
After all this time you still can not search tasks on Android. So you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for. Going down to 2 star.,0
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself.

Honestly perfect. Allows for you to add subtasks to major objectives and is very cross platform compatible.,2
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high.",0

"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app.",2
"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be.  BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that.  The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.",2

"A great app for setting routines, simple to use and very customizable. A slight learning curve for the routine setting, eg. The +/- symbols. A few things that could be improved: easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time (from the pro version) or the same routine (from the free version). Also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well. The comment text style could also be better differentiated title/tag of the event.",2
"Migrating from Wunderlist couldn't have been more painful. First I had to open Microsoft account just for this app. Then, importing from Wunderlist messed up owners, all lists that were shared to me ended up as mine, I had to re share them to the original owner again.

I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",0

Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.",0
I like but there are some basic features that aren't free.,2
"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",2
"Starting maybe in September I've started having issues. I will add an event to the calendar (which is synced to google), but within a few days the event will get cancelled (w/out notice of course). I can appreciate that the problem stems from Google sync. Nonetheless the problem is serious as it has to do with the chore use of the application. Anyway, I personally still use the app as the visualisation is still way better than Google's. So for me that still beats the major con.",1
"I prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone/tablet (Huawei Mediapad X2, 1920*1200). When the keyboard pops up while adding a task, I can barely see what I'm typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape.",1
The Google Calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months. They don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication. TickTick is becoming very tempting.,0
"I use To Do to track my college assignments and projects. I had tried several other systems but none had the organizational power of To Do. I love that I can have a list for each class and attach a due date to each assignment it. The built-in Planned list pulls all assignments from my different classes into one list and sorts them by due date. I'm also planning to start using it for my Getting Things Done system (David Allen), which I currently have in Evernote. It's a huge win for me!!",2
I went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn't.You have to buy the full version,0
Outstanding app!! I really tried some and this is the only one that helps me. Thanks!!,2
"I re-installed this app last week and it's been great but recently it won't plant the tree when I press PLANT. It shows the countdown in notifications, but the actual app keeps showing the Planting screen with nothing happening, which kinda defeats the purpose of the app.",0
"Disappointed - needs complete connection to your Google account to work, too many ads, and most features don't work in the free version. Time wasted.",1
"Really nice, great new take on daily calendar but causes constant appcrashes",1
Finally a habit tracking app that lets me choose the frequency of my goals and habits,2
"This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.",0
"Best app ever! It keeps track of your habits and, if you turn on reminders, it also keeps you accountable of the goals you set. Simply genius!",2
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad,0
To many features locked behind premium,0
"The app keeps crashing every day, and wouldn't open. Every morning I got to reinstall it and log in again... What's wrong...",1
well it was good until it just kept crashing and I don't know why,1
"Been using for a while now. Getting buggy, needs update",1
Good but expensive,1
Not a movable app,0
Love this app. It makes viewing all my Google calendars in one apot easy! My only issue is entering locations because I live in a rural area and it recommends places in large cities all the time.,2
"2 things would persuade me to make this my task list: automatic synching 
via Google drive, and an Ike-like view (a 2 by 2 table showing urgent vs 
important tasks). It's good to be able to categorise tasks into lists but 
equally necessary to know where you need to spend your time. Google 
""Eisenhower matrix"" for ideas. Would also love to see a Chrome app for 
desktop use.",1
"I'm using 2 calenders and 1 To Do planner not including this. All has their pros and functions I want, yet they're different in style. This is one of the best. I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender. But I just love how I can use this a bit differently for scheduling. Best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function.",2
worst app doesn't work,0
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,0
"the app itself is a wonderful idea, but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion. it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit, and i still don't understand how to use a task groups or steps. I gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one. Anyway, I will definitely retry after an update :)",1
"Not user friendly at all, they definitely need to work on the user experience.",0
Very good app. Simple to use.,2
It's a very efficient and useful app but I'm disappointed in the stats function. It started out lagging a day behind - fair enough - but now it's at least 5. I like having stats to motivate me and this feature is now useless.,1
I downloaded it and login with Google I never did anything just logged in with Google. It has asking me many time for auto debit for subscription so I uninstalled it. But still 5 min before Rs 909 debited from my account. This is the muging of money. I want refund my money in my account. Kindly,0
It really helps in focusing but there is this premium thing so I cannot do many stuff. I think you have to pay or get the premium thing to plant trees in real life but I like how there's this different kind of trees and stuff like it has music!!,1
"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",2
"The MOST IMPORTANT features needed: 1) a MULTIPLE sort features like alphabetical, then by priority, date, etc (we are talking about very organized people using these lists) 2) a data import and export feature to backup & import lists (csv files so the 500k+ people who used ListMaster can transition to your app) while keeping our info safe (if our phone dies or is lost or stolen) 3) a feature to attach files or pictures Make ALL of these additional features for $1 month to get monthly income",1
Good,2
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.,2
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,0
Contnuously improving and yet very good since the beginning. Very clear UI and design. Easy to use. Great job !,2
This app is outstanding! I love dark mode so I upgraded to premium & it's 100% worth it. Excellent app. Great to organize & motivate yourself. Thank you,2
An amazing app with a creative concept. One of the best task managing apps out there,2
"This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.",0
I remember the days when you bought an app and owned it.. Now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity. I simply refuse to rent my own notepad.,0
"It's ok but new trees are way too expensive, and only few change their form with the time passing. You can also pay with app-coins to buy sounds which are available all over the internet, including other apps. I would love for the developers to add new features tho!",1
Can't find a way for new entries to be added to the top of a list rather than bottom.,1
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.,1
cant complete subtasks through widget .. huge turn off,0
Oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time. Also it is not uninstalling.,0
"My wife and I used Wonderlist for years to share grocery lists, to-do's, packing lists, etc. The transition into Microsoft To Do could not have been more painful. Duplicate imports and no sharing between work/personal accounts made the move harder than it should be. But the most frustrating thing? I can no longer click and drag to order items in a list!! I be in the grocery store runnin around like a psycho cuz my list be all scrambled. And that's before I even look for toilet paper.",0
I've been using the app for years and can't think of any improvements.,2
No adding option for the time,0
Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.,1
Best Todo list/Organizational application I have found. I have tried many different apps like this one before finding ticktick. It's proven extremely useful for organizing my day to day tasks and chores.,2
Widget doesn't work,1
It is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear,1
Excellent and detailed beyond average love it!!!,2
Why isn't this also an Android wear watchface?,1
add notebook page,2
Best calendar app I've come across.,2
"Pls and pls, kindly refund me. I was charged yesterday. I didnt realize that i was still subscribed to the app because i deleted it. I cant afford it right now cuz i dont have a job and i still need to pay my tution fees. Pls refund me!! Crying** pls refund my money",1
"The app works once and the second time i try to open it, it just refuses to open! I have redownloaded the app many times but this problem continues. Other than that, I really enjoy this app. Edit: I have sent the problems on the said email. Edit: they did respond and the app works fine now :) excellent customer service!",2
"It does what is it says, love this app. Would there be more features like history and analytics about habits and routines etc.",2
It would be motivational for me if I can set the start date of my goals.,1
"Like the app, but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times",2
I can see my day at a glance with out screen beign cluttered,2
Paid for premium and now I keep getting ads after the update.,0
This is an amazing app. I've tried so many habit trackers and todo list type productivity apps. This is the only one that's kept me engaged. And the community is so wonderful.,2
"I really like any.do and having my to do list and events in the same place. However I have knocked off stars because I need more customisable repeat options and notifications. Sometimes my tasks are every two weeks, or every other day, or every 3 days. Would be nice for this option. I also like to put reminders in for my work calendar. I don't seem to get the option to change this when doing a new event reminder. Can't afford premium. Shame. Back to Google calendar. :(",1
"I would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured. 
I don't mind the week number or anything, I just wish I could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly.",2
"I can't share my lists with my partner because I'm told I'm using a work or school account, but I'm not. No such problem on wunderlist.",0
"I would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured. 
I don't mind the week number or anything, I just wish I could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly.",2
"Note 10 plus - buffering issues. Timeline feature and The Coin ""+"" sign cause the app to go into buffer mode. So those features eventually are unavailable.",1
Great app. Still waiting for RTL support and sub folders. Please!!,2
idk if its my phone (android) but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app :/,1
"Cannot see events on calender, only dots.  Need prettier colors/themes for women.",1
Really easy to use and great for calendar blocking,2
"Every day I use it more and in conjunction with the the array of over flowing product offerings vailable. My level of appreciation for what I see coming from Microsoft going forward continues to deepen, hand in hand as my level of understanding in the solutions increase",2
Hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because I'm a student and I need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available... üòíüòíüòî,0
COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability,2
I like the design and speed of the app But some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful ( but they need to get money someway right ) The only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks,2
Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.,0
After updating.. Ads took over the screen.. Disappointed.. I'll look into other calendar apps as alternative.,0
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.,0
"I went from touching the app once a day to once a week, over the span of about 2 months. Would be better if notifications were functional/ could be enabled. I like the concept of being a hero, though. I just always fail all my daily set tasks (repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha...) -- I stick to my sticky notes app (with reminders) that I've been using for years. [Edit 11/10/19]: I see notifications on appear on my phone now! Thank you.",1
Nice app but the price scared me,1
"I absolutely love this app. I am a sorter at heart, so being able to divide my list into the different sections of my life is very helpful. I also LOVE that I can add others people to my lists. This helps me keep everyone on the same page. Thank you Microsoft for helping me organize my life.",2
Zokay,1
Its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many?,2
ok. its useful,1
Amazing tool for time management... particularly for people with ADHD,2
Cool app! I use it everyday!,2
"Perfect except for one thing. The 'I want to...' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list, making it more difficult to cross off. There is already an add item button on each list category, so I think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it.",2
"Just one neccessary thing, just one thing - and it is missing... To see only your today and earlier incomplete tasks in the widget. Automatically. Every day. With different due date colors, depending on if it is a today task, or earlier.",0
"Hey, Great app, though recently I have started to experience an issue. The app is continuously asking me to refresh the background task, and as a result it's not consistently showing notification, if i forget to do so.",2
"As great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it. 'rate us', 'congrats 10 days in a row' really? I can see the result. Please add an option to turn off all popups within the app.",1
This app is awesome. At the moment while we're in quarantine. I have to do a whole bunch of school work and it's just easier for me to make sure I'm doing everything. Make sure I'm getting everything done and it's just really great. Thank you so much!,2
"Very useful, great clock widget with my schedule. It is better if can open calendar app by touched widget.",1
"Synced well with Wunderlist to import lists, but despite having reminders activated, I get no notifications to remind me of upcoming tasks or events... which makes this pretty redundant as a Wunderlist replacement.",0
previous it working very fine but now there lots issue with the application. eg. if you had not complete yesterday task it wont allow you complete today tasks even reporting is not working,1
"I've used all of the popular and some of the lesser known To Do List apps. This is by far my favorite. You don't have to have an account and has more options. But you should for back up purposes. The only problem I have is that when I miss a task, it says due 10 minutes ago when it's been 2 hours. My tasks do show up on time though. The times vary, but this issue started when I created an account.",2
It's cutting edge of all to-do-list apps! üí™,2
Not user-friendly,0
"Great design, autocomplete the date if you add words such as ""do something Wednesday"" and many other autocompletion features It's the best out there for sure, and I've tried them all",2
Love it! I have enough coins but I still can't purchase trees.is it only for the premium package?,1
Please add a transparent widet. Swipe to finish tasks would also be nice. It would be really great if we could add comments to individual tasks.,1
Cant view a month in one screen. One week is the maximum that it will show. Uninstalled.,1
Have to pay for a dark mode lol,0
Nice app,1
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""",0
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""",0
"this took quite a bit of setting up. , but now it is working again I like this Calendar.",1
The app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me.,0
"The first 2 slides are black and I can't see character in the character creation. Some message saying ""path 'profile' required habitica...i hope this gets fix soon. Until then I I'll wait.",0
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.,0
"Coming over from wunderlist, started the import and its been ""importing"" for 2 days. Only half my lists have transferred, seems hung.",0
"So far so good. Just started using this app about a week ago. It's working well and is pretty clear cut as to adding or editing the habits. I like the option for reminders. If it continues to work well in the next few weeks, am thinking of buying premium at discounted "" launch"" price of $4.99 . That describes widgets as an extra and I am just wondering what that means.",2
"I'm using 2 calenders and 1 To Do planner not including this. All has their pros and functions I want, yet they're different in style. This is one of the best. I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender. But I just love how I can use this a bit differently for scheduling. Best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function.",2
Good premise. Just doesn't sync with any calendars. Unhelpful guide,1
Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...,0
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),2
I appreciate being able to schedule blocks of time to tackle tasks (I also love the grocery list app),2
Landscape mode only? Big problem. Cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8,1
Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,2
Excellent time management and gives you a real sense of your day. I would however had liked to be able to change dates to see how other days are looking.,2
"Very versatile and customizable! Still new to it, but it looks very promising, if not polished yet.",2
"I love this app! I have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized. However, only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices.",2
"I love this. I use it all the time to keep track of client appointments, as well as keep notes of events. Extremely easy to use and set up. A+",2
"Good simple app and interface, well made. Would prefer a free, advert monetization model than sub model. I dont plan to pay monthly and free version is somewhat limited for my purposes.",1
i am using pro version and its pretty well organised applicatiom among its competitors. but my suggestion is that please make a significant difference in tree for varioua time period. for example most of tree looks same at evry time period,2
It's an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it. Looks nice.,1
I use the Pro version. But What happened to the option to purchase holidays? My Christian and Jewish holidays don't show up anymore.,0
"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.",0
Simple and efficient app.,2
Not the best but better than others,2
"Would be better if it didn't rely solely on Google calendar. Great concept, but would prefer adding events directly to the clock myself rather than having to put it on Google calendar first.",1
It wont let me login at all my old miceosoft password never is used so i tryed to use me current one for my gmail and it wouldnot work,0
The app is great but the notifications are not working. Please do help with this issue.,2
"Like the app but instead of monthly payment, it should have been a one time app purchase",2
Easy to use to schedule repeat event alarms. Easy to create different routines and turn them on or off. This feature was helpful for me. Only item missing is a time tracker for client jobs or training specific tasks. Even manual tracker would be good.,2
Really great! I have trouble staying focused on my studies but this had me studying uninterrupted for hours on end. I live all the great designs but I just wish there was more options for the start up pack for the trees and the ambiance music but overall brilliant!,2
"This app used to be helpful, now it doesn't give me notifications unless I open the app. When I do open the app, I am slammed with overlapping ""reminders"". I have tried everything in the settings, but nothing has helped. I like all the other aspects of this app, so it's a shame that the one thing I need it for doesn't work any more.",1
Excellent service!,2
It does exactly what it should do in a very clean yet detailed way. Excellent app that has helped me conquer addiction. I love it,2
"After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling.",0
"no longer syncs with alexa. useless for my needs edit: thanks for the response. I'll raise it by two stars in the benefit of doubt. hope Amazon solves your issue fast, as alexa is integral to your lists.",1
Too complex,0
The app is amazing...but my leave the app feature is not working cause i want whenever i leave the app the tree should wither... But that's not happening..... Help!,1
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.",2
"Would be better if it didn't rely solely on Google calendar. Great concept, but would prefer adding events directly to the clock myself rather than having to put it on Google calendar first.",1
"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",2
It's amazing,2
"After some time I deleted this app because of the lack of storage and now I downloaded 3 times but I starteded growing plant this is obvious but I can use my phone and the tree dosen't spoiled and it dosent give me remainder and this app is full updated repair this problem it don't giv remainder to me, repair it soon as possible!!!",0

"Its a really good app that has helped to motivate me to revise, i just wish that you could plant real trees without having to purchase forest premium, i also like the design of the app and how easy it is to use",2
At times it doesn't even buzz or come up on my phone that I had a task to complete. I'm not sure if this is just my phone though.,1
I like it and to be honest for a free app it's Pretty good. My only gripe is that the home screen widget doesn't update. However it's good enough for me to leave tick tick !,1
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!",0
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.,2
I'll try this one,2
"Unrecoverably crashed, reinstalled. Then the data partially gone. Pretty disappointed. No response from the devs. In hindsight this is an app that haven't released for more than a year, so could have been expected. Data is not critical of course (bunch of date markers), but it feels like all those habits disappeared with the data :/",0
Nice,2
Very helpful,2
I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.,2
I found this app difficult to use. That's just my personal opinion. I uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use.,1
"Only just discovered there's a bit of a, sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted",0
Amazing,2
"Great Very usefull, please add fitur search to find an old note",2
Total waste of money.,0
"Excellent app, with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users. I love that it can be used across multiple platforms. That being said, it's super unreliable so I'd never upgrade. Repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day, needing to be marked completed as many as 5-7x before moving to the next day. Sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear; maybe related to server syncing. But not always, so you better remember (defeats the purpose)!",1
"I had several recurring events to keep track of my week, but after the update, they disappeared.",1
Great way to stay organized,2
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app.",0
Quite good but also need some improvement,1
"In general, this app helps me keep track of my habits, which is great; however, the app has quite a few bugs, even after buying the premium version, which is disappointing. The sync function doesn't work at all and I don't see any effort to fix these issues. This is one of the rare apps where I won't be giving a 5 star review.",2
"I love this app. The only change I wish they would make is that certain words and all numbers become dates that the app tries to make into a deadline. Sometimes I just want to write the word ""tomorrow"" without it thinking that I want to do that task by tomorrow or on tomorrow (for example)",2
"I like the app because it's just as it is described. It is very easy to adjust times for focus, tree species to plant, and the motivational messages that are showed keep me going forward. I don't the fact that the trees and music are both too expensive. other than that, not really any challenge",2
"Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.",0
"The only bad point is I can't tick the sub task box on the widget, and this is quite disappointing.",2
Good game like real game üëåüëåüëå,2
Works great!,2
"Very clear app to use! -> Please add a widget with dark background (now there are only light and dark transparant) -> Would also be nice to have a possibility to make a task that can only be checked if other task is done (i know there are subtask possibities, but there are not so clear how to use then and they are not being showen in the main windows untill you open the parent task)",2
Simple and effective! although charging for color themes is ridiculous. I understand getting charged for the other add ons but color shouldn't be extra! The widgets are white and black see thru which makes it hard for me to see. little dots aren't helpful.,1
I already had bought the full version and now I have to pay again which is whatever. But furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that I had before. I just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and I have none of my important calendar events now.,0
Beautiful üòÜ,1
Essential app I have ever Installed... BUT I couldn't set customised ringtone for notifications... Why?,0
"It's been a good way to get things done, and the concept of an RPG is very well executed. The reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface. My wife uses it on iOS and it is light-years beyond what we have on Android. Much cleaner, more useful information, and less clunkiness.",2
Hard to use,1
"Horrible! So many steps!...Set a due date, set a reminder, set it to display in My Day. The reminder set screen is 2 different screens for date/time. The My Day section is the only way you can organize by reminder time for scheduling purposes. Once it's in My Day you must manually move the items in time sequence. Takes up way too much time to organize your day! Importing did not work after several attempts. The setting reset themselves to default after I set them.",0
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad,0
"Just starting and learning how to use. Unable to set correct due date on tasks. When I select that task has a due date, todays date appears. When I click that date the calendar displays. Allgood so far. But when I select a date on the calendar and close it, the due date is still today.",0
"I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(",2
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling...",1

"An option for smaller text would be realllly nice and distinguished, it's so big and bulky looking and only fits a couple habits per page. Fun and actually works. it doesn't have a history for or even track your habits tho........ but still best app ever!!!",2
How to use this app? ü§î Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.,0
"it's a pretty good app, but its has a serious glitch, the goal day isn't functioning properly. No matter which goal date you set, it will always be the same day you created the task. ( like you finished today )",1
Excellent look and feel. I will change my score to 5 if you add a homescreen widget to observe our forest. Thank you.,2
This app doesnt sync data.,0
Best app for daily life.,2
"I love the widgets for this app but there are some synching quirks that drive me nuts ?!!? Not sure if it's the app or the stock Google calendar but whichever it is, it's not a good combination !",1
Just OK,1
Good,2
this is very good,0
So addicting especially for gamers who love to level up!!!,2
"I like this app i really do. However one caveat i feel is that it can only sync to a gmail or the native phones calendar. Outlook calendars are not supported as far as I can tell. So for me, I work with outlook, thus any meetings etc cant be viewed seamlessly with respect to a current timeline plan.",1
"I like this app quite a bit. It has more useful features compared to the normal Samsung calendar app. It does not, however, play well with Google. In that I can't ask Google what my agenda is and have it pull info from this app. Lame. Hence 4 stars only. Not sure if that's a Google thing or a thing for this app. Otherwise I like it a lot.",2
"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier.",2
This is my favorite daily schedule app! It is so simple to use and super versatile. I paid for the pro version just so I could do everything and it was well worth it!,2
This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,0
Awesome,2
"Bought the pro a few years ago. However, recently went to a new phone, and now I'm seeing ads, and it doesnt look like I have the pro version anymore. Not sure what happened but jacked up that I paid for the pro, and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again.",1
It's Good,2
"I've been using the pro version for four years and loved it until recent year-end. During the holidays, daytime sync with Google Tasks stopped. When I wake each morning, I find that many or even most tasks have synced, but can't force any more syncs for the rest of day. I've reset and reinstalled the app without success. With the holidays over, I need to resolve this and get back to work, and find that I can download other competing apps that work great. Please fix.",2
"Very useful application, thanks! Could you please add tags grouping? Because I have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess!",2
"If you delete the app or transfer phones, you will lose everything! All past progress is gone and you can not get it back. You also can never use that login info again. Just keep that in mind. Also if you set your habit/goal for example twice a week, you'll still get reminders everyday. No options to change it to only notify when goal needs to be completed.",1
Could not get app to consistently stay connected to my Google calendars,0
"Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos.",2
Few days after downloading it shows that forest app can't open or open app again .,0
I was told to install Planner Pro instead of Planner Plus (which was what I already used) in order for my cell phone & iPad to sync. I have had at least 5 emails back & forth with the contact person but I still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed. I guess I will have to go back to my Google calendar. I love the Planner Plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and iPad.,0
"It's really a great app and good concept to cure phone addiction. But I've some ideas for making it more interesting. Introduce forest customization options- like a real forest. Add animals, Cascades etc. Anyway great work guys!",1
Can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars. Disappointed because this app has promise.,0
Best Reminder app!,2
Good way to keep in touch with actions - works well with planners.,2
Supper helpful for me as a busy college student. I often forget all the things I have to do each day and this helps me visualize what's next. I want to get an Android Wear just to have this app also on my wrist. It's that helpful. Also I just bought pro and I love the colors! Please keep the support and updates coming. Thanks!,2
"Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have unlimited habits 4 stars only because there is no possibility to set monthly repeated task neither on a specific date (e.g. 3th of every month) nor on specific day (e.g. second Wednesday in a month) Otherwise it would be 5*",2
Was a good app but the 'improvements' made have made it fairly useless. Especially the widget. I don't pay premium prices to have an app get worse. Please restore,0
lose my time :(,0
Great for neat month view. Unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders AFTER the event? Not good.,0
I started playing with it and it freezes often and I don't like how my notes have to be on that day and not just by themselves.,1
I can no longer touch the widget to open the full app. What happened? I use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen.,1
"I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.",2

a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat. I use it daily.,1
"Doesn't let you say you did something yesterday, which is for me a big deal, as I browsed the options looking for a way to do that almost everything was only a premium option",0
"I love this app, but it sucks that I can only use it on my phone. I'd give it a 5 if I could a) use a desktop version of the app as well; b) sync tasks with Wunderlist;  and c ) sync reminders from Google Calendar as tasks on Planner Pro.",1
"I thought it was a really good app until today. It started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup. I lost all of my options, to-do lists,  achievements. Don't know what should i do, really disappointed. Auto back-up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files(not dropbox)",1
"good app,but Im a premium user for more than one year and have been requesting features on the official support forum (like change dates of lots of overdue dates at once on windows app) and never even got a response.",1
"time zone doesn't work, i have my phone in a different time zone than i live in and have managed to change most things to my home time zone. this app allows me to change my time zone but it doesn't actually reflect the change anywhere. the date and time of the app and events stay incorrect. my phone is on Taiwan time for now and i have set the app, the preset for events and every individual event to mst, but when i open the app or use the widget, the dates show in Taiwan time still",1
Don't know how to use it because many icon were showing to upgrade to new version popups.,0
Ugh... too complicated just want plain priority list. Uninstalling.,1
Easy to use. I will however like to have a time boxing feature for my daily activities.,2
"Could you make it offline for while.. i dont like being forced to be online 
all the time..",1
Need to update the calendar more..... otherwise perfect,2
Great app. I wish it had two features: the ability to add directly to a folder without having to move it. And the ability to resize the widget to a smaller height.,2
Good app easy to use. I like the fact that it emails my daily to do list.,2
Multiple account support without unified view... Really disappointing .,0
not user friendly,0
"This is awesome, my life is easily organised with this app, and I could look at everything and visualize in a whole calendar. :D",2
only option is paid subsctiption app? No thanks. I can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so I'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads.,0
There needs to be a feature to purge completed tasks. Its cumbersome to to have to delete them one by one or by selected all and deselecting the upcoming tasks. Potential to delete active tasks.,1
alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser,0
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,0
Apparently I rated this app one star this time last year but I don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving  the app is good. Unfortunately I'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view(not Google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar) so until it's put into the app I will be uninstalling and standing by for the update.,1
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,2
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.,1
"I loved this app, but recently (since 31st December 2018) the ""chains"" are no longer being made even though I'm meeting the criteria for the habit. My streaks have been reset at 0, even though my score has stayed at 100%. Very confusing and annoying! Any help would be greatly appreciated.",1
This has made my life so simpler and better. Amazing planner app. Sync across all the devices. Sub task can be added. Task can be allotted to your team. This is superb. They deserve much more appreciation then they get.,2
Do you have any plan to make desktop view? I am using pro and pretty happy except that part. Getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view. A bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot.,2

How can i set a task to repeat daily or weekly ??,1
"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things.",1
the day pro widget view shows events overlapping despite them not scheduled at the same time. It's an annoyance but an overall decent app.,1
"Ads with free apps are acceptable, but fullscreen & non-skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are NOT. Awful user experience. Google has recently removed 600 Android apps from Play Store because of disruptive fullscreen ads, this app may be the next one to be removed. Not recommended.",0
Needs more features but I just started using it so I'll let u know specifics soon,1
It is amazing app. It was working great a week ago but i don't know why from this week it doesn't count the time properly for example if i studied 4hours+ it only shows 1hour. But overall i really like to study when i use this app. I hope they fix the bug soon.,1
Cool,2
"Irrespextive of having task completed, there should be a way of having access to your ""do list"" as long as it is not deleted. One might want to crosscheck a few sruffs. They should fix that issue.",1
"Overall good app. Interface is easy to use, effective and powerful. Would be good if it had better integration with calendars and other services. While many features are free, premium is a continuous subscription and quickly adds up to be very expensive.",2
Missing integration with Google calendar.,1
"great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality, look to Any.Do rather than this app. In dialogues with the devs, theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple WearOS apps (like add task from watch). Uninstalled",0
Pomdoro is bad,1
No hourly reminder.,0
"I like the app, but I don't like rating apps, and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop. Even with the paid version, so 1 star for being annoying after I've given them my money",0
Very nice app and easy to use,2
"I use it everyday and completely love it. It is very simplistic to use and understand, even for older folks like me! If I'm putting together a list of projects I want to get done; it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot, then title and save it by Category! Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",2
"The best to do app I've used by far. One tiny feature/design request : Can you please show the subtask count (total and completed) in the widget as well. Currently I need to click the task in the widget, which leads me to the task screen on app which shows the subtask count.",2
"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. üëé",0
This is a good app,1
"Best free calendar app I've used, syncs with Google and outlook calendars...... ....Edited from 5 to 2 stars...the video ads are too painful.

"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",2
"Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed.",0
This is a great app...helps me a lot...but I have 2 problems: 1.the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up.....it used to give proper notifications before...but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time. 2. another problem is that I'm not getting the coins I earned ! Sometimes when the notification doesn't come (as described above) I don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins. I request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible !,2
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.,0
Amazing app for studentsüò≤üò≤üò≤,2
Love it! Works very well and isn't inundated with ads. I don't mind an ad here and there and this app has it perfected,2
"Its refusing to open on a daily basis now, downloading it over and over is not fun. Any suggestions ? Forest has really helped me in keeping distractions to a minimum and maintaining focus. Update: I'm still facing the same issue üò©. Help a girl out.",1
"The app is great but things aren't automatic.. like there's no notification to make me use the app even though i turned it on in settings, and the quote of the day is constant until i change to next even if days pass by.. it should be set to auto change.. other than these two fixes i love the app!",1
Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.,0
Great but over half the time when I edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected.,1
Would be better if it was possible to add to the top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner. Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed,1
"I was skeptical at first, but wow! Yes, the req to have a Microsoft account didn't thrill me, but this has all the features Wunderlist did and more - you just need to find them. You CAN move the order of tasks manually - just do an extra long tap on the task and drag. There is also a an inbox - here it is just called ""tasks"". This app is much more flexible in terms of themes than Wunderlist was and it makes it really easy to both delete tasks and steps within a task. Switching was easy too!",2
"I never thought I could switch to a digital planner and yet here I am, my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar. We're all synced up on Google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on Artful Agenda with the lists I need to run my box and family!",2
Vibrates even in silent mode without vibrations (even on 485),1
Very good,2
Great app! It really helped me to be productive throughout the day!,2
"Great app for staying focused, good way to track your time spent working in a more fun and engaging way",2
Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,2
"i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization. but, i set alarms and keep in mind, i have all permissions on, and it didnt go on my screen, so i missed a very important meeting.",0
Love this app. Helps me a lot!,2
Treating activities like a game Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully finish my duties and earn XP.,2
Can we please have sub tasks Placed under our main task‚Ä¶ ? The analytics are not so useful to be honest..,1
What a great app! It has completely made my days more productive and organized. Thank you so much Microsoft! I can't wait to see it linked to OneNote üòä,2
im sure the pro version is great but it didn't keep my interest long enough,1
still getting to grips with the app. I'm sure it's great.,1
"This app is fantastic! I work from home anyway, and with the disruption due to the Coronavirus, it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule. By the end of the day, I hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone. I downloaded Sectograph and it has made all the difference. I am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy. I even recommended it on Twitter yesterday.",2
"Highly user friendly, but the free version lacks some of the useful features...",1
"It is very useful, and helps my day yield more",2
"No snooze option for reminders. This causes some task misses.  Please look at the app ""To do reminder with alarm"" for reminder buzz types and options. It would be good if these features are added in future.",1
it s great,2
"Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now.",2
Helps you organise in a jiffy!,2
"I recommend this app to all of my friends for studying! In addition to the focus help, it motivates me to get more done and to challenge myself in new ways! I especially like seeing a whole forest for a day, month, etc. Sadly, there was no way to transfer my plants when I got a new phone, so I am having to unlock plants again.",2
"The only thing I can't stand is every time I get a notification, I get two notifications for the same event. I sure it's a setting but I can't find it.",0
I like it ü§û,2
"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",2
"I like that the app in simple. I turned off the motivational quotes, so all I see is the calendar. And that's all I need to see! One thing I would add, though, is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak. One of my goals is a daily activity that I can only do at home. When I travel, I miss those days. But I did it every day I was able (i.e. every day I was home), so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized.",2
This app needs a combined list of all accounts to make it usable...,1
Doesn't show a files attached to the event using Google Calendar.,0
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing,0
What I love is that I can make multiple calendars with the same account. What are some Major problems? 1. My events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who I include in the event. Sending a text message link doesn't work either. 2. I have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation. Never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a Very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to... This is detrimental. P.S. I paid for premium,0
"A very interesting idea. I would give 5 stars, but there are minor bugs in the apps. I can't choose my user name, it says there are all taken. (I'm sure No one else would use it) and I cant add a daily task. It shows an error when I try to add one. ""is not the enum for frequency "" or something similar. please fix this, I really love this idea.",1
overall alot of features. can make the app more organise using colors. cannot find way to export when switching phone.,1
Screw you m$ uninstalled,0
"I love the app but I wish there was a separate page for notes. (I know that you can add notes when you create a task), but I'd like to see a designated page just for notes. Other than that I never liked subscription models, I think way more people would actually buy it, myself included if it would be a one time fee.",0
this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,2
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!,2
"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",2
I uninstalled because the app was a little confusing. it has a great idea and all bit I just didnt quite get how to use it...,1
"To Do list apps, like this one, are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks. Too bad because the interface is otherwise well done.",0
Who puts ads on a calendar?! Y'all that desperate for money smh.,0
no reminder tone else 5 star,1
I love this habit app and the customization ootions. I use it to track exercise and also build up/break habits im trying to start/stop.,2
"So, I did not get it. Does this app only import events from Calendar? Can't I create my own daily routine within this app? That would be way cooler to be honest, as I barely use Calendar.",1
Widget is not working in nova launcher.,1
"There's nothing wrong with this app, although it could be slightly better, but.... It's just like Google Calendar. In fact, it's integrated with Google Calendar, and all your events show up in GC. Even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same. If you're an android user, go ahead and just use the built in Google calendar, if not your Samsung/HTC/whatever one. I have near stock android, so I get Google.  Same difference, really.",1
Very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers.,2
"Allowed all the permissions for this app but i still can't get the reminder to work on my smartphone running Android 8. Downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it, and it worked well.",0
It does the job,1
"Downloaded ticktick. Thought it seemed cool, so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription. Kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card. Waste of time.",0
"I don't know why,but the app isn't supporting my phone.It was good till 2 days and later on it stopped responding.But I do appreciate the thought you have put behind it.",0
very nice app. i frequently used it since 2014. until now.,2
"This app is good, but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus. I believe there should not be any kind of limit like 10 min. Remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute.",1
Very pleased. Practical and clear. Upset that 1. I paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet; all I get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost. 2. Tasks is accessed in 3 steps. Why not 1?,1
Love this apps. Would be great if can aks before delete task,2
The app is ok cancellation is very awkward. If you make it difficult to cancel a premium account it puts me off your company and your product.,0
"Great way to track tasks. Reminders, priorities, repeating tasks are hugely helpful to keep me on top of what needs to be done.",2
"This app is the best to schedule my day! Further more, here are some possible features to add! ; a homework option w/ reminder, water reminder, mood tracker, monthly routine, and calendar? Also would like if premium was cheaper :(",2
"want to put a line through items but leave them visible. don't know how to manipulate to keep certain items from week to week, but cancel others. no instructions. but better than other apps that I've seen.",1
"Nice app, but the cool stuff is locked for the membership",2
"I don't understand why do I have to turn on the screen when I grow up the tree. When my screen turns off because of inactivity for 10 minutes, tree dies again. I installed this app to focus on my work (not my phone) but this app keeps requiring me to turn on the phone. It's paradoxical..",0
Lovely üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,2
Great easy works fine no problems,2
I like the usability and design a lot. Unfortunately it has to be synced with your normal calender which is a deal breaker for me. I wanted to seperate work from my private life to keep a work life balance. It's sadly not possible with this app.,2
Tells me tomorrows activities are overdue today,2
"when you switch the language, you get wierd bug that your app is half in English half in selected language",0
Demands premium account for serving the most basic features,0
"i really like this app, it helps me focus with my tasks and study, but hope you get rid of the messenger pop ups, i could still get notifications and able to view it without losing a plant. but overall i love it.",2
"The best app in the market for improving your daily habits. I researched many Habit apps in Play store and finally concluded that this is the best one. I changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through HabitNow App. The user interface is superb and quite simple. Also it provides habit statistics up to date. You can also enter your habits according to the category like Health, nutrition etc..A must have App for everybody!!",2
Good app.Useful for studies.Well done guys.Buddha also taught to love the nature.As buddhist Ial appreciate this,2
"If you pay for premium, you won't actually get the premium services (as other reviewers have noted). Troubleshooting steps from their site don't work, and no one responds to the support email. Contact Google and they'll reject your refund request.",0
"Inspite of the event or task completed tasks being shown on the list. As per the reminders and their timing auto arrangements of list is not there. The first and most early created event is reflecting on the top rather than time based or priority based. If an event created on my day if that was not completed, its not getting carried over to next day as due.",1
This is closest to my expectations,2
"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app.",2
First impression is sufficient but not excellent. There are no settings for applying priorities to tasks and I couldn't find also a setting for repeating tasks (daily or for certain periods) for specified hours (from 17:00 - 20:00).,1
"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!",2
Great app to track your daily tasks. It is very customizable!,2
Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.,2
It has deleted all of my entries planned for today. I am going to try a new app.,0
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",1
Im enjoying it so far,2
"I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.",1
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.,0
"This app is good, but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus. I believe there should not be any kind of limit like 10 min. Remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute.",1
Now when I get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification. There's no way to change this. Edit: reminder pop-ups is already switch OFF.,0
I love this app. Only issue is there is no check mark to check if you completed something. Of course in a perfect world we get it all done and don't forget but for those not so perfect people I wish there was a way to check off what you finished for the day,1
"This is the best task keeping app out on the market. It has a very easy interface, and many useful features that are blended together well into a useful product.",2
"Love it, but it has some major flaws: (1) Can't personalize THEME. (2) Can't configurate WIDGETS' toolbars & what details are displayed. (3) The widget's size is too wide‚Äîmax 4x?. Would love it if it were more flexible. (4) You cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in ALPHABETICAL order on the Day widget; it will always be sorted by time. (5) The app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen. (6) App stops working a lot for seemingly no reason.",1
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar",2
The feature that I liked in Wunderlist is that you could move items around on your list manually. This is missing from this app.,1
Upgraded from Wunderlist and lost the ability to reorder tasks within a single day once it is ordered by date. Very disappointed.,0
"When I'm entering birthdays, I have to enter on the day after, or it shows up the day before!! I have one birthday permanently hooked to a holiday, and I can't edit it. Fix this, PLEASE.",1
"*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.",0
Instalei de novo e n√£o mudou muito minha ideia. Quero um calend√°rio e n√£o uma ferramenta pra integra√ß√£o com o calend√°rio do Google. t√° de sacanagem,0
"It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.",2
So addicting especially for gamers who love to level up!!!,2
Mandatory registration,0
"free version is all you need, paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits",0
"Wildly impressed at how much this has helped me to continue to get more organized in life as a whole, not personally and at work, its inexpensive for the subscription and can do so many things, most of which I have yet to tap in to, I feel so much more in control as this keeps everything in front of me and I k ow what I have to do and when",2
I love the interface and the colors. It's very smooth and fun to look at,2
This app is very helpful However I had bought this app on my apple device and just recently swapped to android and now if I want the full version of this app i have to re-purchase it to get all the facilities,2
Ads ads ads.,0
"Thanks for the response. The fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and I think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set. It is possible to want an event to repeat without getting an alert. Also, why is the default ""notification"" when there is a date? All tasks with dates do not require a notification.",2
"Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!",0
"Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared",0
Super usefull....plain and simple,2
It's awesome!,2
Microsoft is like Wanderlist. Originally had issues sharing and syncing this To Do List app. Appears to be settling down. We like to it now.,2
the User Interface makes no sense,0
This app is amazing to help me focus and study and do assignments. I have brought the pro version but it wouldn't allow me to sync the trees I have planted on my laptop to my phone. It would be amazing if they could fix it!,2
no comments,1
Love it!,2
"Good app, but notes become a paid feature so uninstalled after a few days.",1
"Amazing work done for this app. I have looked for a long time for an app which was fast, well developed and really easy to use. Keep this way always!",2
it crashes everytime i open it whenever i go one day without using it,1
Not getting notifications,0
Awesome,2
This app is really good because i dont get distacted as much bc i dont want my plant to die so i stay off my phone. It also helps as i want to unlock more plants so i stay on the apo longer (work longer) to earn more coins to get more plant. Would recomend if you find your self on tik tok or social media when you are suppose to be working/doing school. This is really helping out this quartine Thanks!,2
"As always MS makes the best thing, but fails to offer video training and integration and some basic CRM features. Needs imporvement on 1) multi importance/priority level with drop down box and for sorting.... 2) ""Repeat"" doesn't add today's to-dos, just an alert. ... 3) Beable to organize more than just today....add wk mo & yr. .. 4) CRM and Calendar need upgrading and integration with Outlook app..... 5) Training??",2
AFTER THE LAST UPDATE I CAN'T CONNECT TO THE APP ANYMORE WITH MY VPN TURNED ON WHICH IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!!,0
I really like must of the app but it has 2 horrible bugs that made me uninstall it. Whenever I make a new event in the widget it places it a day after the date that I chose and then the edit button doesn't work and you are stuck with it and it might get confusing. I might download it again if that is fixed.,1
"This app is a good idea and I like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet, I could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning.  THIS APP WAS NO HELP TO ME ALL I RECOMMEND IS THAT THE APP HAS TO BE A BIT MORE SELF-EXPLANATORY I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!",0
"This is the best and simplest habit app that I have used. I had tried a couple of others and never stuck with them. I use the notification feature to send me a reminder to mark off my habits for the day, so I don't even have to think about remembering to update it.",2
Yah.. best and very useful aap,2
It lets me get out of app and my tree is still growing. It doesnt prevent me from using phone,0
If you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time. This is the app for you. Love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life. Perfect!,2
"This app is a great help for me! This helps me enjoy productivity in whole new level. I have been struggling for years to get my life back together, but with this app I feel like I can finally get some work done in a fun and enjoyable way. Thank you very much!",2
Good,1
"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",2
"Was interested in trying out the premium features until I saw that they're a subscription, and a ridiculously priced one at that. Unfortunately the simple functionality of note taking, which used to be handled very well by many apps seems to be harder to come by. Haven't found an app yet that will integrate with Google assistant in any useful way.",0
Widget not working,1
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!,0
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?,2
"Despite working fine with the web version of the app, this Android version of Ticktick throws a validation error on my email address when I try to sign in because (according to Carol, a ""dev"" of the Ticktick team with whom I spoke about this on their help forum) my email address features hyphens. Tf?! Since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting. Terrible, imo, UX (both in app and for customer service).",0
Implement collaborative lists please! so crucial.,1
I like the app. It is very practical and quick to apply but you have to purchase more targets if you want and there is no inspiring pictures I think I should pay for it too.,2
"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos üôå",2
"I love this app! It helps me to stay organized. It's very convenient. I used to write my to do list on paper, but it's so much easy to have this app right at my finger tips. Its allows me to break my list down into categories, and use different colors to differentiate each category.",2
Very good.,2
"good app ,but some feature are to be updated still like, it should actually calculate the petcentage of work done by us on each task and should be more attractive i think so",1
"The app is pretty good and has good features. However, when I shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him TONS of emails regarding it. Literally 1 every few minutes for hours and I have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing. Given that sharing is a big part of why I wanted the app, it does put a damper on things for me.",1
I deleted the app but it is still charging my PayPal account. No one is responding to my messages at customer service. Please stop charging my account.,0
Amazingly good experience that lets you manage and plan your days ahead and let's you take some time for yourself out of the haphazard schedule.,2
"Just what I've been searching for. I like the compact view of the routines and tasks, and the satisfying way to mark them completed or not. The sorting options are useful. It would be great if you could add automatic syncing to gdrive at some point.",2
"EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you.",1
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph",0
Great app! Too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only. I'd like to have a calendar layout of the week.,2
Wonderful app to keep you up to date and to remind you to complete your tasks in time.,2
"All the activities planned or unplanned for today should appear under ""My Day""...",2
Nice app but pls include better sounds,2
Fantastic app! It has so many options to adjust. I love the widget on phone screen. My husband has started to use it as well. Thank you!,2
It's good but has some points to improve.,1
This cannot sync Outlook :(,1
Super helpful and has definitely increased my productivity as a student. Would have loved to have discovered it years ago. Great job devs!,2
It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.,0
"Overall great organization tool, however recent updates make the application only usable in horizontal view which is extremely annoying and quite an inconvenience",1
Account gets blocked after 1 day. Happened twice with different mail addresses. Only possibility to solve is to give the mobile phone number. Won't do that :(,0
It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.,1
It really helps me stay organized and keep track of my goals.,2
So you reskinned LifeRPG? What's different here?,0
All of the free features are really good and I am way more organized,2
"It helps tho, but I can't access premium account even if I had enough load credits in my phone network.",1
Keeps me organised very happy with would be even better if it had functions to support Dsylexia sufferes.,2
Too many items,1
"The app still doesn't work well. I can still go back and use other apps... When I press the homescreen button, last time it didn't work and I couldn't use other social medias. Now, the tree grows while I use the app...",0
"I have noticed when I write notes and leave the app to find out more info, the app locks which is fine, but what I have written before I leave the app is not saved which can be very annoying. There isnt even a warning or option to save before you leave the app",1
"App freezes every time I add a task, when I close and reopen the app the new task is there like nothing went wrong...",0
"It's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits. I had been gifted premium early on, but I've found that the features have disappeared and I'm only seeing the base version. I like it enough that I want to buy it, but I worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews. I've also found a bug: when I have a goal set to 3x a week as ""success,"" the app doesn't recognize when I've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section, whereas it's at 80% in the ""percent success"" section and many weeks of meeting my goal.",1
Easy to work with,2
Not happy that when a new task is entered it goes to the bottom of the list instead of automatically to the top like it did in Wunderlist. It's crazy that you have to drag every entry to the top of your list.,1
It's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design.,0
"Widget Request: please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget? Or an option that removes done tasks from the widget.   Good job on the app otheriwise, I'll repurchase if you can add this, love the snooze function.",0
"Good app, does what I need it to.",2
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,2
So far so good. I just need to remember to look at it.,2
Yes at first attempt it look user friendly. I am pleased! ! Good App,1

"Great app, I only have one complaint: The Tavern system doesn't work. I went on vacation and knew I wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter, so I entered the Tavern thinking I was safe for the couple weeks I'd be gone. I just reopened the app and it told me I had died twice, took all of my gold, two of my items, and decreased two levels. Honestly considering deleting the app now, as I had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment",1
I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!,0
Hodtf coder jbikhkhkm kvukb,1
It's my most favourite app. Thanks for creating such an amazing app.,2
I really like this app. But I stopped using it because it's too hard to type out my entire routine on the app. I wish it was windows compatible.,1

I searched for quite some time to find a calendar app that my wife and I could share. Business Calendar is an excellent solution. We have it installed on our phones and tablets and all are in sync. No more asking what she is doing today. Thanks BC team.,2
The developers got back to me within minutes and helped me sort the problem out within a very short period thank you support! Widget was being blocked by battery optimizer. *previous review *Paid for premium however the feature to mark complete on the widget is not working. Will do 5 star if this can be resolved.,2
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it,0
planned not bad,2

"This app is great, closest I've found to what I want! But I wish there was an option to add ""goals"" instead of just ""habits"" and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders. Sure, I want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches, but I also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months. :)",2
"Dates and times? No such thing here Sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death, but strangely enough there's no changing when a 
reminder will go off, no setting when a task is due (perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting), or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task. It can be put in the details, but when time is of the essence 
you're better off using a better task app",0
Really amazing and helped me sooo much just i hope that it can be sharable by more than one person for group planning one line and it will be world organizer or making groups ... thanx for developers,2
Has literally changed my life. I use it for everyday tasks and chores. My husband and I literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house. I also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and I can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it. Absolutely life changing.,2
I can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch...ugh.,0
I dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service,0
The time displayed does not automatically update. One has to cluck on the widget and enter the app for it to sync with actual time.,1
It's okay,1
Great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points,1
I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!,2
Has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money,1
Refreshing tasks is a nightmare,0
"A great way to work on self-improvement with friends, hold eachother accountable, and have fun!",2
helpfull.,2
I love Habitica! It's a habit tracker and to-do list that actually motivates me to get things done via the gamification and fun social aspect. The world of Habitica feels like a supportive community of people holding each other accountable and helping each other accomplish their goals. Doing my daily chores is so much more fun when I turn it into a quest for magical potions and eggs!,2
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!,0
"The app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things I need to in a day. Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable. It is discouraging, frustrating and hurtful when I try to check off dailies (or do ANYTHING on the app) and it doesn't let me because of connection failures. I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests. Myself and friends all have the ""connection problems"" in different locations on data, or wifi at the same time... Fixes are quick, and interactions/responses pleasant! Great app!",2
Sync is not good,0
"Nice app. but, why it doesnt sync with my google acount? I mean when I add a new task, it does not appear in my gmail task!",1
I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .,0
"does not seem to work with google calendar, I see no reason to give them my payment info for a free premium trial. // I managed to add the google calendar. it took all the events, bur not the reminders in calendar . I still won't use this, as it seems to be a replacement interface but I like the google display better. I don't need to pay this much for few benefits to me. I have not found anything that I like yet, either.",1
"I was so pleased with the new Habit tracker as well as using a true Dark Mode. However, I don't agree with the Premium policy as I prefer to make a bigger one-time payment (such as when I bought Final Cut Pro X with Apple) instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to Todoist. It's a damn shame as I liked TickTick so much I'm willing to pay for Premium. Unfortunately, the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker.",2
"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",1
"Wonderful app and great customer service. This app has replaced 2 or 3 of my old apps. This is the most customizable list app I have found. Colors can change, tasks can be rearranged within a list, lists can be rearranged. Tasks don't need a due date or time, but can be assigned either, along with notifications or alarms if desired. I had a small issue with sound, emailed support, problem solved in just a few days. Excellent!",2
There is no ability to comment like in Wunderlist. Had to individually share all my synced lists with my husband and then he had to accept and delete all the doubles. Should have just been able to share links with another user.,1
"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E",0
"Overall it works, but not so easy to use. When you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off. Sometimes it's hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited.",1
One of the worst in the genre,0
"It's supposed to be able to go on multiple devices yet, when I downloaded to my phone after putting it on my tablet it just keeps saying loading. After I spent a lot of time setting it up and plugging in all my appointments for the next month it's a huge disapointment. Should I get fixed I will change rating to a 5-star",0
i have bad experience,0
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???,1
"I installed because of the option to synch tasks, but that is one of the features that unlocks for $4.99/yr. No issues paying it if I liked the feature, but with no chance to try out the one reason I download the app, I uninstalled immediately.",0
New features update now please ...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§...!!!,1
"Amazing app. Perfect blend of features and polish. One thing I gotta appreciate is that even to new users who haven't decided on subscription yet, it's so clean. No in-the-face BUY ME messages. It's so clean. And polite. The subscription is totally worth it since it really does offer that much. Love it. Kudos to the team and community for making it what it is.",2
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log.",1
It's a great app for tracking habits. So far I find that purchasing the premium app has been worth every penny.,2
There is a glitch in which it do not keeps track of your hours of study My target is 5 he's and if I studied for 1 hours than I add it and poof next day it shows 8930 hours,1

"Love that you can have several lists, and sub lists, and set reminders/deadlines.",2
"Great app, just like Wunderlist and more. The only thing I am missing is the ability to arrange my important tasks in the order that I would like. Please add this!",2
I CANNOT CHANGE the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally I would like to have them in chronological order.,0
"EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you.",1
"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review.",0

I have never rated an app before. I rave about it to others. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize. I love having the widget on my phone. I expanded it so I can see many items on my list. I love the different options for reminders and snoozing. I have a hard time transitioning from task to task. Only thing I struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks (hold and drag). Works better for moving tasks down than up. Maybe my screen is not responsive enough or I'm clumsy.,2

Installed and started setup. EVERYTHING I INSTALLED THIS FOR REQURED A SUBSCRIPTION. ONLY INSTALL IF YOU WANT TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING. IT probably should be stated that ALL the good points of this app require a SUBSCRIPTION. I AM NOW UNINSTALLING THIS APP.,0

Removed two stars because of the horrible checkboxes. Changing things like that without a option to disable is a disrespect to paying customers. [previous 5 star review] Recommended for anyone who wants the most feature filled to-do list. Tested a lot of them and this really stands out. You can adapt it to a lot of workflows and the new integrations made it even better!,1

"Just one thing and I will definitely change to 5 stars. Make the 'Quick add bar' easier to use! Just expand the letter 'ADD A TASK' in the notification bar. Or at least make it easier to reach when using one hand. I'm right handed but the 'add a task' is located on the bottom left of the bar so it's hard to reach with a thumb. Please, I believe it's not too much to ask for.",1

"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to.",1

Just started but easy to use. Not accustom to all features but this app makes sense,2
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",0
It keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character... ugh ! Not worth it UNINSTALL !,0
"App UI is really good, i have tried almost all the top task list apps and like any.do best however would like to have Heisenberg matrix added to organise my tasks. That is the one thing stoping me.

"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc.",1
"Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.",2

Why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without? Give me a break you filthy parasites.,0
The check boxes could be bigger and other such things could be made clearer.. Also an option to see all the items in individual folder from the 4*3 weekly widget.,0
This been really working well with me. The community is great too. It's very useful and the widget is great feature. Though how about costumizing the app theme? Like using different color theme instead of the default purple. Because it will look prettier for my widget :D,2
"Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period).

"Overall, the app does what it's supposed to do, but a few quality of life features would go a long way - for one, a list for ""later this week"" would be nice, as would the ability to nest lists more than one deep.

Syncing frequently fails or takes forever, and is often too slow between devices to make the most of the other capabilities of the app. Honestly if a better option came out I'd jump ship in a heartbeat.",1
Pomdoro is bad,1
"there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like Micr_oso_ft's to do, and many other. why people think this app easy, it's not. I donated on this app and wasted.",0
Love it.,2
"I love it, compared to other apps like it. but i do miss the features that epic win has, that you can sort your to do s based on the day.. so you can set up to dos for the future, while in habits it all shows in one list instead of being separated by date",1
"It's not syncing right with my gmail. My recurring events are all messed up but, are right on my gmail..... Deciding whether to keep it or not.",1
Wonderful,2
I like it it's very reorganizing,1
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes.,0
"I have a big problem with this app, daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it. But somtimes i really could not complete it. then it's stop repeating, why?!!!! plz fix it",1
good,2
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.,0
can't even name my tasks,0
Not sync with Google Calendar,0
like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups. tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return. the response lag and language issues are frustrating. this changed my review and I removed the app,1
"I love this app. I tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction, I guess? The basic features are good, just right. But I'll give it 4 stars since I'm still finding something I myself can't say and it's not here. Maybe it's in the premium version but I'm broke as hell and I can't afford to pay for it because I have other expenses. I do hope that some other features would someday be free, it'll be really helpful.",2
"I paid for the Premium version and had expected it to work. Unfortunately, I've been missing quite a few reminders because somehow they stopped working. The notifications didn't show at all. If this problem persists, I want to cancel my monthly subscription.",1
Just what I was looking for. It's simple which is all it needs to be.,2
Helps me keep on track of what needs done.,2
"Its a Productive app.Helps me to have my focus off the phone.The concept of planting variety of plants and trees eventually having a beautiful virtual forest of yours(I'm using the free version) is outstanding.Not to mention the ambient sound feature(not explored yet).I'm happy to find this app. Suggestions : Add more varieties of plants,trees & decoratives in the store.Also, add animals in the store, it will bestow in users the idea of having wildlife in their virtual forest. Thank you",2
Kpai,2
NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,0
"This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.",0
"App idea and design is great, but it is not possible to add calendar from Work Profile account anyhow - it is just invisible. Android 7.1.1.   Promise rating 5, if fixed.  Upd: thanks for prompt reply, but it is about Google Calendar in Work Profile - it creates a separate copies of Google Apps for it. Please have a look at work profile specifics for Android 7+",1
"wint really allow you to use it or even save tasks, (which disappear). you just get bombarded with limitations and STOP SlGNS if you try to use features while having ""upgrade to ""premium"" ads"" shoved down your throat. I don't even know if this app works or not...that's how "" limited "" it is.",0
Paid the 2.99 for the calendar sync as I really needed that and found that it didn't work. However they quickly refunded my money and the issue may have been with the compatibility of my phone.,1
a great app! has some kinks that need ironing and I'll update when they're done. But I love this app and use it daily - as intended üòä,1
This is the best to do list. Also growing your karma level is fun.,2
"Nice idea, but the problem is that i tried to see what happens if i close the app and use other stuff like games, it said that the tree would wither, but when i come back after playing the tree is still growing. Is this normal?",1
Have to push too many buttons to approve my route. Not hands free friendly.,1
Notifications are still premium feature? Okay,0
"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app.",1
"My life is a million times more organized with TickTick. I just wish that they'd do a one time payment rather than subscription, but I'm sure they've done their market research. Love them!",2
This App have good design and good Features. I am using this app for 2 weeks and I comfortable with this app.,2
There wasn't a synchronization between the app and outlook mail calendar.,1
Nice,2
"So I assume this app is no longer supported by its owner? Last update was summer 2018 and I saw lots of negative reviews here and on twitter about owner not responding at all. Wanted to buy premium, but first checked reviews... Ugh, it looked like a really perfect app! Sad.",1
Great apps to organize and manage task and practice habbit.,2
Hey guys the new update messed up the widget layout for me now everything is smaller and more difficult to read!,2
I have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working. I mailed them but got no response,0
Its good but can work on notifocation panel,2
So far I really like it. when will the stickers and tablet features be ready?,2
"I've tested several tasks apps and this is my favourite. Super simple though effective! The views are just great. Plan by project and execute by due date. Overwhelmed? Add to My Day just what you feel you can accomplish. I would just suggest a ""delete done tasks"" button, because though you can already hide them the list can become quite big if you use, as I do, recurring daily tasks.",2
I am on a Sony Xperia Xz premium Android 8.0.0 and the app when I move out of the app and use others does not wither the try thus spoiling the point. Yes all my notifications and permissions are on. Please help so I can actually have incentive growing the forest. There is no crisis notification when I move out of it or onto other apps.,0
Very useful app,2
"I don't often buy apps above the basic level, but Business Calendar (and now Business Calendar 2) has helped me keep track of appointments so well for so long that I did. I've now had premium for almost a year & still thoroughly enjoy the added functionality & appreciate that the app is fully functional (albeit with some added time required in some cases) at the free level. Thanks for such a great app, & please make this app for iPhone too so my partner & I can use the same calendar app!",2
"Reduced one star because there is a pro version..5 stars rated when there is another pros version?? It cant be, right? Reduced for another star because i suggest that you should have a 'pause session', check it out from the study bunny.",1
"i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner.",0
Good app but only counts by day. 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well.,1
"I really like this app for the most part, but I really don't like how the month view in-app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day, just colored dots. Would really like to be able to have this since I paid for the Pro version, please consider!",2
"I loved this app, but after the new update I am unable to use the widget. Uninstalled.",0
App is great in terms of tracking or developing a habit and has great customizations for each. I loved the option of reminder but very dissapointed that it never works. I never get any notifications or reminders.,2
There are better alternatives.,0
good app but skills glitch out all the time.....fix this for 5 stars,0
It's very versatile; the project system makes it easy to group tasks together. The one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view.,2
"Edit: You have to buy the pro version if you want to sync your calendar, which to me is an essential component of a time planning app...",1
some reason just recently the app uninstalled itself or somehow or another it got uninstalled and I haven't been able to receive any updates or any calendar events for the last couple weeks,2
Free version only allows 9 lists. Lame,0
Very easy to use,2
"Looks really good but... I'm not going to pay a subscription for it, sorry. If you said one off payment then maybe. Most of the locked features are available in other products out there.",0
"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",1
"This is a great app, and would be 5 stars. The reason it isn't, the early reminder notifications stopped working for me, at all. They had been working fine, then for no reason that I can find, they stopped. I've tried reinstalling the app, but this didn't fix it. I am getting a reminder at the time my tasks are set for (or 3 - 4 minutes late) though. It's incredibly frustrating as this is the only app I've found that offers early reminders, and I'm trying to use that to complete tasks on time.",1
It's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time...,1
i wish to have flexible goal like do xx minutes exercise per week/month,1
"So far so good! I've used other reminder apps. With ADD I have to have reminders of nothing would get done. This one let's me snooze the stuff I want to procrastinate on. Or if I need to be annoyed by the reminder, I can do that too. All around good app.",2
"trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot. I just get the message ""file not found"" with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so I can get it in the right place.",0
"If you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all, then this app is for you. This is NOT a user friendly interface . Does not play well with 9.0 pie (but not much does).",0
"Awesome, increses productivity",2
I wish it could use the Hey Google feature. It only works with Amazon Alexa right now. Price is cheap. So far so good.,1
It wouldn't let me in,0
"the widget keeps distorting itself. resize fixes it, but not for long. edit: monthly widget, nova launcher. Nova launcher has worled great for me trough several Android versions. I'm not going to the stock one. your widget was also not working in android 8+nova. I upgraded a few days ago.",1
"I can't upgrade to pro version. Anytime I hit the Unlock button, the app will say ""some error happened (6). Please try again later.""",0
I liked it...nice features but not giving the colour changing option (premium only) is just cheap... I wish I can set my own music for my reminders,1
"needs registration, for online use...",1
App itself is nice but needs a lot of polish. Right now it's kind of a bugfest.,1
"The app will put by default new tasks into Inbox but Inbox is not what you see when opening Todoist. Instead you might see that there are no tasks for the next 7 days. There's no logic in it, app's assistant integrated with Google Assistant fails to find any tasks, even if asked specifically about those in Inbox. Todoist is cumbersome and annoying, it's actually a general problem with task apps: they're too much and fail to actually do what they are made for.",0
"Overall decent functionality but clunky execution. The premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone, which defeats the purpose for me. The sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult.",1
Super easy to use and very addictive. Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a uncomplicated and easy tinuse to-do app.,2
Great,2
"So far so good, simple and functional. Would like an easy way to quickly move items from one list to another as I shift things from a general todo list to a today list each morning. Clear clean and ad free. Love it.",2
"Have been using the old Pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much. Just started to use this new one not long ago. It has a more contemporary design, simplified and streamlined options, but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star.",2
How do i go pro does this app only work with facebook I dont have face book.,0
"Hi, im using the paid one on my phone and ipad. However i find that they do not sync well on both. Like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone, then whem i open on ipad it's not marked. But then both updated according to the ipad. How do i make this better? Also, can there be a way to skip a habit? Sometimes i missed it and i dont want them to keep appearing on the list.",1
"Pretty good but when I'm adding a reminder please don't assume the time will earlier in the day than the current time. Also, it goes a little haywire during the transition to/from Daylight Savings Time.",1
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.,1
"Love the app. Love the rewards. But, I wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous, and I wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever. Also, certain things are hard to navigate... but overall, I absolutely love this app. Use it every day. Not so much for challenges or battles, but for habit making and to do's.",1
"Awesome app, really. Especially for students managing their time. My friend actually introduced it to me and I would be glad that we could view each others' profil without using the Pro thing. Like, we can remain focuse TOGETHER even if we don't live near each other.",2
The only calendar app I have used for several years. I occasionally check on Google Cal and others but none have reached the same of features and presentation.,2
"Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category.",0
The best app for planning I met.,2
Just add 'To Do List' feature. Highly recommend.,1
"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",1
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive,0
"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.",0
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!,0
Great app! Kept me organised and disciplined. Thank you üëç,2
Cannot use without existing calendar,0
"This is unforgivably close to perfect. Why no timer? So many tasks are long-term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit. You could have it where once a task was selected, the timer would start, and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed.  As it is, I have two pair this app with a different promodo app.",1
The pop-up advertisements make the free version impossible to use. I will be forced to change to a different app after years of use,0
"Would be awesome except when I put start in weekly view in the settings, I can no longer access monthly view or change the settings ...",1
"i think the app is satisfaying my will. but the pro version keeps a non-ecard user not happy, so im giving you 3/5 bcuz of this.",1
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",0
"Engaging and effective. It doesn't seem to be possible to use a Google Play balance to pay for gems, though.",2
"Advanced yet simple. Love it, has all the little features you need without the unnecessary complication. Alarms, sidenotes, ability to highlight some tasks, organize tasks in order u want",2
"Still needs some work to get it up to par with Wunderlist, but works ok",2
I've recently started using ticktick. so far so good. It would be nice if you could alphabetize the items checked off so that they are easier to find when you want to add them back to your list. I haven't found a list system that does that yet.,1
"Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.",0
Pretty good but it'd be better of there was some kind of mini game option where your avatar does stuff like fighting or studying along with you. I dunno it'd just be fun to have that extra interaction and to give meaning to the points system.,2
"This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential.",0
"I really like the paid version of the app, the only request i would have is I use this app for pomodoro (25 min bursts) during the work week and I miss having the full tree image. Is there a settings option to change this?",1
"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events.

Easy to use smart and flexible options,2
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect,0
"Yes, I started with a 3 star review, but I did drop it down to a 1 star review. Why? The developed asked me to send a screenshot of a spontaneous mismatch between what I typed and what the app accepted as my task. As per every ""busy"" developer, he requested for me to email so that he quietly resolves the problem. I will not do so; he may take off my review, but every user be warned: You may retype your tasks with this app only for the program to clear it when exitting the edit menu.",0
"It has very nice, useful and comfortable look, I used it with a pleasure. Unfortunately synchronization with gmail calendar stopped working. Tried to reinstall this app - it helped for a week and stopped working again.",1
"It's effective. Yes it's better than a lot of other options out there. It's just dated, the interface is weak and difficult to navigate. They could really make some strong improvements by streamlining it. I bet most users, pro or not, aren't aware of all the settings. Response 8/8/19: Thanks for the offer but I think you're missing point. If I had time to help I would have long ago though. Response: I wouldn't have paid for an app that required me that much submit feedback in a forum.",1
"Pop up stating "" the app has been blocked by the system. Please authorize the app in your device settings. Troubleshooting or refresh background tasks "" is flashing on my device. May I know what is this about?",0
"Fine for tracking, but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks (this has happened with every new habit I've set up, and I have a premium account) and the developer doesn't respond to support requests.",0
"You have not made it possible, as far as I can see, to assign certain tasks to separate people inside a list...... When I go shopping with my husband he has his assigned items and I have my assigned items. If you have made it possible to do this then please let me know how to access it. I am not as happy with this app as I was with Wunderlist and I'm sorry to hear that you're getting rid of the perfect app",1
"Very good app, it's simple yet you can add layers to your tasks. My only issue is that, you need to pay for some features that are important for executing your tasks.",2
"Useful as a to-do list. Sets a real annoying ""plan your day"" popup reminder every morning. How you disable it is non obvious. Uninstalled.",0
Not as good as Wunderlist. Simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as: 1. sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to My Day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened - makes adding lots of pages in a row slow. 2. Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list. Other than that it looks smart and imported my old Wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt.,1
The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,1
"Needs a widget! Once it has multiple different widgets, calendar, to do list, grocery list...etc I might revisit it.",1
"My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further.",0
I used to love this app but I have bought a new phone and whenever I open the app it crashes and doesn't open. I've already uninstalled the app and installed it number of times but still the problem exists. Please look into it ASAP!,0
Too much ads appeared out of no where.,0
"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar.",2
"Every other month, I think I'll do better. I try again. I download this app. Everything gets back in order, so I uninstall it to free up space in my storage. Then I relapse. I download the app again. This is a never ending cycle of desperation, loss, and hope. I will always download this app. I will always uninstall it. 9/10 would recommend",2
"Since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input. Apparrently due to poor internet connection. Now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for January, needless to say none were regesterred!!!",0
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,2
Very usefull app for divideing tasks,2
"An amazing all in one; to-do list, pomodoro app, calendar app, habit tracker... I have made a video about it and all the people who have tried it, were impressed by it. I just love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è. Thinking truly about purchasing the full version.",2
"Ok good to know, thanks! It still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock. I'll put some on and it will take them off as I add more.",0
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package.",1
"Syncing doesn't work. That was the whole point of upgrading to the Pro version. I log most of my time in the Firefox browser plugin, and it never shows up in the app. I also lost my account. My account wasn't authenticating, so I logged out. When I tried to log back in, it didn't recognize my email (even using Forgot Password). I ended up creating a new account with the same email I know I used before, losing all of my coins. You guys should look into any backend issues with syncing and accounts. Thanks.",0
To much time consuming and confusing features,1
Intelligent intuitive design! This is how I would have designed one for myself.,2
Very useful and easy to use.,2
"Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).",2
"Thanks , great app Please add Persian language",2
"Amazing app, meets requirements, and even excels them. Well done on this app, and notifications, notes and reminders are all taken care if and safely delivered to you on time. ‚ù§",2
I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.,2
"Thus far, I'm finding To Do useful. It feels a step up from Wunderlist. Time will tell for sure.",2
Super,2
I couldn't find a way to link to Google Tasks. That is my first priority so I have data backup and desktop list edits.,1
"INCREDIBLE for keeping motivation up, but the mobile app is intermittently buggy in odd ways. Definitely still highly recommend it, though!",2
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.,0
"Seems like it could have been great for me. However, lack of ability to modify repeating schedule (e.g. which days of the week) is a blocker. Switched to HabitHub for now.",1
"The best, cleanest, most uncluttered to do list app. Thank you Matt for sharing this",2
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",0
"It was the best app I've ever used until the last update. I can't plant the tree even though I click ""Plant"" it starts at first but then stops counting time. I'm so sad...",0
Many features are locked and require a subscription. Did not want to pay without trying. And even given the limitation the trial period is limited to 1 week. This is too harsh. Uninstalling.,1
Great app.,2
It's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design.,0
Great,2
"Easy to use, intuitive, has issues to share the kist woth somebidy if one of the use is using a school or work account. Non collaborative.",1

Great app,2
ok,1
Please integrate Kanban from web to the mobile app.,1
I had a premium. Scam.The app is very pushy and annoying. I couldn't get into 80% of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen. You only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped. You have to call back then. Disturbing and annoying. I barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time. I asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly(!) subscription.,0
The wigit doesn't come with the free version. It does the same thing your Google Calendar can do. I was looking for something for time blocking ... this is time flopping,0
Not worth of killing Wunderlist Some crucial features such as comments are missing in the app,0
Deleted app due to not putting things in I was looking forward to using this app I am getting the same issues as sharlyn,0
not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.,1
"Whilst *most* of he functionality is there, I preferred the look and feel of Wunderlist much more.",1
You can customize color and transparency of every single part of the widget. You can click on events for detail view.,2
"I'm adding a star because the import from Wunderlist was seamless, but otherwise the fact that I cannot drag and drop/reorganize stuff manually absolutely sucks. Soon as I can get my lists imported into something else, I'll be moving on.",0
"Worked great in beginning. Enjoy multiple lists & sublists. But now I have a task ""haunting"" me, it won't let me delete it. Wrote developers, we'll see. Using SG8+.",1
"Why did you change the chat order? :( Now the newest messages are at the bottom, it just feels so unnatural, it was fine before it didn't need a change",2
"The only problem I have come across so far is, the day calendar does not change automatically. In order to get the current date on the day calendar is to go to the month calendar and select today's date. That said, the program and UI is better than the pre-installed calendar program.",1
"Please stop with the updates. Especially on the desktop version. You're just making it worse. The most recent update sucks! Stop! At least make it so you can add all of your previous ""my day"" tasks from yesterday with ONE tap. I'm tired of having to add each one individually.",0
Since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye.. On top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it. Disappointed.,0
"I couldn't even sign with Android, it kept saying the password is wrong, I ended up changing the password and still didn't login! Wasted an hour.",0
"Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this.",0
This app is absolutely amazing and helps a lot during exams but after a while it starts crashing and I lose the previous history and the trees I get using the coins.That is really disappointing. This has happened more than thrice. Kindly look Into it. Other than that it really does keep one focused.,1
Awesome app does what it's supposed to aside from reminding you. I always forget what I'm supposed to do because it wont remind me at the right times. :(,1
"Just what I was looking for! Google calendar is good enough but it doesn't have this, this is what I needed. Now I can see all the hours that I have free during the week.",2
Fix permissions for 5 stars. Great design and UI but you shouldn't need access to my contacts to login with my Google account. Google provides an API for it that all other apps use without contacts permissions.,1
App is one of the coolest app but some functions i didn't understand properly what's their functionality.,2
isnt this basically a calendar that is for all phones.,0
"Great app, the best time setting interface of anything. Only feature I don't like is if you change the start time of an event it proportionally changes the end time so you have to change the end back to where it was and if you change it enough to span the midnight hour now you have to change the days too.",2
Doesn't beat most others in it's free version and too costly in the paid,1
"This app is really good but I have a major issue with it. It helps you focus, not to get distracted but sometimes I need to a calculator or google or a dictionary I can't because my tree will die!! So I need to exit the app(the tree is still growing) and then I can access google or what not please let the app access certain apps if possible.",1
It is a very helpful app,2
there are some bugs in the latest version that i haven't had before. it's always lagging and nothing is loading in the app.,1
Great apk,2
"The app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings, easy to use",1
"I like all the scheduling possibilities and tools. I'm giving it 4 stars because the alarm I have set thru the app can't be turned off. I had to uninstall it, just to get it to turn off. Very annoying.",2
The app is perfect but one tiny problem: the reload icon is sometimes peeking out at the bottom of the list title.,2
Would love love LOVE LOVE an offline mode. I spend 3 days a week without internet and have trouble keeping on top of my life without structure like apps like these. This would be the one for me if it could also go offline :(,2
"Probably none better, can do a thousand things, but Developer forces you to always think BIRTHDAYS. And, you can't disable TASKS either. If I don't want those functions then don't force it!",0
"I'm considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app: since the last update, the widget has gone completely unresponsive...",1
"At first this app worked well, then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities. It stucked on the last activity before the next day",0
Microsoft version of Wunderlist. Lists can be shared and sync'd between users. Needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position.,2
"Perfect, it is brilliant for everything I need. I have even thrown away my old to do list notepad!!!!!!",2
